1Basic Operation
These Instructions for Use are for clinical professionals using the IntelliVue MP20/MP30 (M8001A/
M8002A), MP40/50 (M8003A/M8004A) and MP60/70/80/90 (M8005A/M8007A/M8008A/
M8010A) patient monitors. Unless otherwise specified, the information here is valid for all the above 
IntelliVue patient monitors.
The basic operation section gives you an overview of the monitor and its functions. It tells you how to 
perform tasks that are common to all measurements (such as entering data, switching a measurement 
on and off, setting up and adjusting wave speeds, working with profiles). The alarms section gives an 
overview of alarms. The remaining sections tell you how to perform individual measurements, and how 
to care for and maintain the equipment.
Familiarize yourself with all instructions including warnings and cautions before starting to monitor 
patients. Read and keep the Instructions for Use that come with any accessories, as these contain 
important information about care and cleaning that is not repeated here.
This guide describes all features and options. Your monitor may not have all of them; they are not all 
available in all geographies. Your monitor is highly configurable. What you see on the screen, how the 
menus appear and so forth, depends on the way it has been tailored for your hospital and may not be 
exactly as shown here.
In this guide:
• A warning alerts you to a potential serious outcome, adverse event or safety hazard. Failure to 
observe a warning may result in death or serious injury to the user or patient.
• A caution alerts you to where special care is necessary for the safe and effective use of the product. 
Failure to observe a caution may result in minor or moderate personal injury or damage to the 
product or other property, and possibly in a remote risk of more serious injury.
• Monitor refers to the entire patient monitor. Display refers to the physical display unit. Display 
Screen and Screen refer to everything you see on monitor’s display, such as measurements, alarms, 
patient data and so forth.
Introducing the IntelliVue Family
The Philips IntelliVue family of patient monitors offers a monitoring solution optimized for the 
surgical, cardiac, medical and neonatal care environments. Combining patient surveillance and data 
management, it allows multi-measurement monitoring by linking separate modules with “plug-and-
play” convenience.1
1 Basic Operation Introducing the IntelliVue FamilyYour monitor stores data in trend, event, and calculation databases. You can see tabular trends (vital 
signs) and document them on a local or remote printer. You can view measurement trend graphs, with 
up to three measurements combined in each graph, to help you identify changes in the patient’s 
physiological condition. You can view fast-changing measurement trends with beat to beat resolution 
and see up to four high resolution trend segments. Event surveillance enhances documentation and 
review of physiologically significant events by automatically detecting and storing up to 50 user-
defined clinical events over a 24 hour period.
There is a choice of monitor configurations, as explained below. All models can also use computer 
devices such as a mouse, a trackball and a keyboard.
IntelliVue MP20/MP30
The IntelliVue MP20/MP30 (M8001A/M8002A) 
patient monitor has a 10-inch TFT LCD flat panel 
SVGA display. The standard input devices for the 
MP30 are the Touchscreen and integrated navigation 
point; the MP20 is supplied with an integrated 
navigation point only. Up to six waves can be shown 
on MP20/MP30 Screens (USA - up to four waves). 12 
ECG traces can be shown on the 12-Lead ECG 
Screen.
The MP20/MP30 can be connected to one Multi-
Measurement Server (MMS) and any one of the 
measurement server extensions. There is an optional 
built-in recorder. The Flexible Module Server 
(M8048A) and all plug-in modules cannot be used 
with the MP20/MP30. With an optional Interface 
board Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring is possible.
MP20Junior and MP20L are options of MP20 
(M8001A) and are not referred to separately in these 
Instructions for Use.2

Your monitor comes with a set of preconfigured Screens, optimized for common monitoring scenarios 
such as OR adult, or ICU neonatal. A Screen defines the overall selection, size and position of waves, 
numerics and SmartKeys on the monitor screen when you switch on. You can easily switch between 
different Screens during monitoring. Screens do NOT affect alarm settings, patient category and so 
forth.
When you switch from a complex to a less complex Screen layout, some measurements may not be 
visible but are still monitored in the background. If you switch to a more complex Screen with, for 
example, four invasive pressure waves but you have only two pressures connected to the monitor, the 
“missing” two pressures are either left blank or the available space is filled by another measurement. 
Switching to a Different Screen
1 To switch to a different Screen, select the current Screen name in the monitor info line, 
or select the Change Screen SmartKey.
2 Choose the new Screen from the pop-up list.
Changing a Screen’s Content
If you do not want to change the entire Screen content, but only some parts of it, you can substitute 
individual waves, numerics, high-res waves, or trends. Be aware that these changes cannot be stored 
permanently in Monitoring Mode.
To change the selection of elements on a Screen, 
1 Select the element you want to change. 
2 From the menu that appears, select Change Wave, Change Numeric, or 
Change HiResTrend, and then select the wave or numeric you want, or select the high-
resolution trend wave you want from the list of available waves.
If you do not see Change Numeric in the menu, this Screen may be configured to always 
display the numeric beside its wave. Changing the wave will automatically change the numeric.
The changed Screen is shown with an asterisk in the monitor info line.22
Using Additional Displays 1 Basic OperationIn the Change Screen menu, the changed Screen is 
shown linked to the original Screen and marked with an 
asterisk. 
Up to three modified Screens can be accessed via the 
Change Screen menu. 
To recall Screens, either
♦ select the name of the Screen in the 
Change Screen menu
or
♦ use the previous/next arrows at the top of the 
Change Screen menu to move back and forth in the 
Screen history. The ten most recently-used Screens 
including up to three modified Screens can be 
accessed. 
After a patient discharge, the monitor’s default Screen is 
shown. Modified Screens are still available in the 
Change Screen menu. 
If the monitor is switched off and then on again, modified Screens are erased from the monitor’s 
memory and cannot be recalled. If a modified Screen was the last active Screen when the monitor was 
switched off, it is retained (unless Automat. Default is configured to Yes). 
Using Additional Displays
A second display, showing the same Screen as the main display, can be connected to any of the 
monitors, for viewing only. 
The MP90 can have two main displays and additionally, as a third main display, the D80 Intelligent 
Display connected. All main displays can be configured and operated individually using standard input 
devices. 
For MP90 monitors with multiple displays and multiple input devices, the usage and behavior can be 
configured according to specific requirements at installation (for example, use for two independent 
operators or tracking of mouse input across two displays). For details refer to the Service Guide.
When two operators are using two displays, the scope of an action depends on the type of operation:
• Patient monitoring operations such as Silence or Pause alarms take effect for the monitor as a 
whole, the results will be seen on both displays. 
• Display operations such as the Main Screen key and Back hardkey will take effect only on the 
display being operated. 
If you are operating two displays with one remote SpeedPoint, to navigate from one display to another:
1 Move the highlight to the Main Screen key and then turn one click further. 
The highlighting moves to a special “jump” field at the edge of the Screen
2 Press the knob on the SpeedPoint to confirm; the highlighting will automatically move to the other 
display.
The content of each Screen can be changed individually as described in the previous section. If you are 
operating two or three displays, you can choose Screens for all displays from one location:
Change Screen
6 Waves A
Split Screen A
Loops
Cardiac Output
Vital Signs A
Vital Signs A*23
1 Basic Operation Understanding Profiles1 Select Profiles in the monitor info line of the first display,
2 Select Display 1, Display 2, or Display 3 then select the Screen you want to display 
on the that display from the list of available Screens.
When two displays are mounted next to each other or one above the other, a special Screen can be 
assigned which spans across both displays. The Screen content for these Tall and Wide Screens can 
then use the increased area available with two displays. These Screens appear in the Screen list with a 
special Tall Screen or Wide Screen symbol.
Certain windows (for example: cardiac output procedure) can only be shown on one display at a time. 
If you try to open one of these windows when it is already shown on another display, you will see a 
blank grey window with a cross through it. 
Using the Visitor Screen
If a visitor Screen is configured for your monitor, you can use it to clear the screen of all waves and 
numerics but continue to monitor the patient with active alarms and trend storage at the bedside and 
Information Center. You can change the name of the visitor Screen in Configuration Mode.
♦ To activate this Screen, select the Screen name in the monitor info line to open the Screen 
menu, then select the name of the visitor Screen configured for your monitor from the list of 
available Screens.
♦ Select any element on the Screen to open the Screen menu and select a different Screen to show 
waves and numerics again. 
Understanding Profiles
Profiles are predefined monitor configurations. They let you change the configuration of the whole 
monitor so you can adapt it to different monitoring situations. The changes that occur when you 
change a complete profile are more far reaching than those made when you change a Screen. Screens 
affect only what is shown on the display. Profiles affect all monitor and measurement settings.
The settings that are defined by Profiles are grouped into three categories. Each category offers a choice 
of ‘settings blocks’ customized for specific monitoring situations. These categories are: 
• Display (screens)
– Each profile can have a choice of many different predefined screens. If you are using a second 
display, each display can have its own individual screen selection. When you change the profile, 
the screen selection configured for the new profile becomes active.
• Measurement Settings
– Each profile can have a choice of different predefined measurement settings. These relate directly 
to individual measurements, for example, measurement on/off, measurement color, alarms limits, 
NBP alarm source, NBP repeat time, temperature unit (oF or oC) pressure unit (mmHg or kPa).
• Monitor Settings
– Each profile can have a choice of different predefined monitor settings. These relate to the 
monitor as a whole; for example, display brightness, alarms off/paused, alarm volume, QRS tone 
volume, tone modulation, prompt tone volume, wave speed, resp wave speed, pulse source.24
Understanding Profiles 1 Basic OperationYou can change from one complete profile to another or swap individual settings blocks (display 
screen/monitor settings/measurement settings) to change a subset of a profile. Changes you make to 
any element within the settings blocks are not saved when you discharge the patient, unless you save 
them in Configuration Mode.
You might find it helpful to think of the three categories in terms of a restaurant menu. The Screens 
are like the first course, offering you a choice of “starters” (many different screen configurations from 
which you can choose the one that best suits your requirements). The Monitor Settings category is like 
the main course, offering a choice of different “main dishes” from which you can pick one. The 
Measurement Settings are like the dessert course. From these you build your meal. You can choose one 
from the “starters”, one from the main course, then one from the dessert or simply pick one or two 
courses without having a full meal.
Depending on your monitor configuration, when you switch on or discharge a patient the monitor 
either continues with the previous profile, or resets to the default profile configured for that monitor.
WARNING If you switch to a different profile, the patient category and paced status normally change to the setting 
specified in the new profile. However some profiles may be setup to leave the patient category and 
paced status unchanged. Always check the patient category, paced status, and all alarms and settings, 
when you change profiles.
When you leave Demonstration Mode, the monitor uses the default profile.
Swapping a Complete Profile 
1 Select Profiles in the monitor info line, or select the Profiles SmartKey. 
2 In the Profiles menu, select Profile.
3 Chose a profile from the pop-up list.
4 Confirm your selection.

Default Profile
Your monitor has a default profile that it uses when you leave Demonstration, or Service modes, or 
when you discharge a patient. This profile is indicated by a diamond . 
Locked Profiles
Some profiles are locked, so that you cannot change them, even in Configuration Mode. These are 
indicated by this lock symbol.
Understanding Settings
Each aspect of how the monitor works and looks is defined by a setting. There are a number of 
different categories of settings, including,
Screen Settings, to define the selection and appearance of elements on each individual Screen
Measurement settings, to define settings unique to each measurement, for example, high and low 
alarm limits
Monitor settings, including settings that affect more than one measurement or Screen and define 
general aspects of how the monitor works, for example, alarm volume, reports and recordings, and 
display brightness.
You must be aware that, although many settings can be changed in Monitoring Mode, permanent 
changes to settings can only be done in the monitor’s Configuration Mode. All settings are reset to the 
stored defaults: 
• when you discharge a patient 
• when you load a Profile
• when the monitor is switched off for more than one minute (if Automat. Default is set to 
Yes).
Changing Measurement Settings
Each measurement has a setup menu in which you can adjust all of its settings. You can enter a setup 
menu:
• via the measurement numeric - select the measurement numeric to enter its setup menu. For 
example, to enter the Setup ECG menu, select the HR (heart rate) numeric.
• via the Setup hardkey (on plug-in modules) - press the Setup hardkey on the module front.26
Changing Wave Speeds 1 Basic Operation• via the Main Setup SmartKey - if you want to setup a measurement when the measurement is 
switched off, use the Main Setup SmartKey and select Measurements. Then select the 
measurement name from the popup list. With this SmartKey you can access any setup menu in the 
monitor.
• via the Measurement Selection key.
This guide always describes the entry method using the setup menu. But you can use any method you 
prefer.
Switching a Measurement On and Off
When a measurement is off, its waves and numerics are removed from the monitor’s screen. The 
monitor stops data acquisition and alarming for this measurement. A measurement automatically 
switches off if you disconnect its module or measurement server. If you disconnect a transducer, the 
monitor replaces the measurement numeric with question marks.
1 Enter the measurement’s setup menu and select the measurement.
2 Select the measurement name to toggle between on and off. The screen display indicates the active 
setting.
Switching Numerics On and Off
For some measurements, such as EEG, you can choose which numerics to view on the screen. 
♦ In the measurement’s setup menu, select the numeric name to toggle between on and off. 
For example in the Setup EEG menu, select the EEG numeric name to toggle between on and 
off.
Adjusting a Measurement Wave
♦ To quickly adjust wave-related measurement settings (such as speed or size), select the 
measurement wave itself. This displays the measurement Wave menu, which has only wave-
related measurement settings.
Changing Wave Speeds
Lowering the wave speed compresses the wave and lets you view a longer time period. Increasing the 
speed expands the waveform, giving you a more detailed view.
The monitor distinguishes three groups of wave speed settings, 
• RespiratorySpeed, for all respiratory waves: CO2, Resp. anesthetic agents and O2
• EEG Speed, for all EEG and BIS waves
• Global Speed, for all waves not included in the other two groups.
Changing the Wave Group Speed
The wave speed group setting defines the speed of all the waves in the group. 
To change the wave speed of a wave speed group,
1 Select Main Setup -> User Interface
2 Select Global Speed, RespiratorySpeed, or EEG Speed as required27
1 Basic Operation Freezing Waves3 Select a value from the list of available speeds.
Changing Wave Speed for a Channel
To change the wave speed of an individual wave channel, 
1 Enter the Wave menu for a measurement by selecting its wave.
2 Select Change Speed.
3 To set the speed to the wave group speed, select RespiratorySpeed, EEG Speed, or 
Global Speed. 
To set an individual channel speed, select a numeric value from the list of available speeds. This 
overrides the wave group speed setting and set the speed for the individual wave channel on the 
monitor Screen. The wave channel speed is independent of the wave (label) depicted in the 
channel, if you change the wave, the new wave will retain the set channel speed.
Freezing Waves
You can freeze waves on the screen and measure parts of the wave using cursors. The waves are frozen 
with a history of 20 seconds so that you can go back and measure what you have seen. 
Freezing An Individual Wave
To freeze a wave,
1 Enter the Wave menu for the measurement by selecting the wave on the screen.
2 Select Freeze Wave.
The realtime wave is replaced with the frozen wave. 
Freezing All Waves
To freeze all waves on the screen,
1 Select the Freeze Waves SmartKey.
All realtime waves are replaced with frozen waves. 
Measuring Frozen Waves
To measure a frozen wave,
1 Select the frozen wave.
If you are using touch, this automatically positions the vertical cursor. The cursor can be 
repositioned by touching the required point on the wave, or 
2 Using the Speedpoint or another pointing device or touch: use the right/left arrow keys to move 
the vertical cursor.
The vertical cursor moves through the time axis and the current value is displayed next to the 
cursor.
3 Use the up/down arrow keys to activate and move the horizontal cursor. 
The horizontal cursor measures the wave value, which is displayed above the cursor line. 28
Using Labels 1 Basic OperationChanging The Wave Speed
Lowering the wave speed compresses the wave and lets you view a longer time period. Increasing the 
speed expands the waveform, giving you a more detailed view.
To change the wave speed:
1 Select the frozen wave.
2 Select Change Speed.
3 Select a speed from the list.
Updating The Frozen Wave
To update the wave, that is freeze the current wave:
1 Select the frozen wave.
2 Select Freeze Again.
Releasing Frozen Waves
To release frozen waves,
1 Select a frozen wave.
2 Select Unfreeze Waves.
All frozen waves are released.
Using Labels
You can measure multiple invasive pressures, temperatures, and SpO2 simultaneously. The monitor 
uses labels to distinguish between them. The default settings defined in the profile (such as 
measurement color, wave scale, and alarm settings) are stored within each label. When you assign a 
label to a measurement, the monitor automatically applies these default settings to the measurement. 
The labels assigned are used throughout the monitor, in reports, recordings, and in trends.
About Label Sets
Your monitor may be configured to use a Restricted or Full label set. The Full label set 
provides extra labels for Pressure and Temp. See the sections in this Instructions for Use on Pressure 
and Temp for more information. 
If you connect a measurement server from a monitor using a Full label set to an IntelliVue monitor 
using a Restricted label set or an M3/M4 monitor, any additional labels switch to labels available 
in the target monitor. This may cause a label conflict with other monitored measurements. 
Be aware that connecting a monitor using the Full label set to an Information Center with certain 
software revisions may affect the availability of measurement information from the additional labels on 
the Information Center. See the Information Center documentation and your monitor’s 
Configuration Guide for information on label set compatibility. 
Changing Measurement Labels (e.g. Pressure)
To change a measurement label of a measurement with multiple labels (invasive pressure, temperature, 
or SpO2),29
1 Basic Operation Using Labels1 Enter the Wave menu of the measurement. 
2 Select Label.
3 Choose a label from the list.
The monitor automatically applies the scale, color, etc. settings stored in the Profile for the label you 
select. You can change scale settings in Monitoring Mode, but color can only be changed in the 
monitor’s Configuration Mode. 
Any labels already being used in the monitor are shown “grayed-out” in the list and cannot be selected. 
Give me an example Let’s imagine you used a Press module to monitor your previous patient’s CVP. 
Now you want to use the same module to measure ABP with a new patient. You’ve set up your arterial 
line. When you connect the pressure transducer to the module, the pressure shown on the screen still 
uses the CVP color and wave scale and is labeled CVP. To rectify this, just change the pressure label to 
ABP. Now the pressure has the correct color, the wave is shown in the correct scale, and the 
appropriate alarm limits for ABP are active.
Resolving Label Conflicts
Each label must be unique, that is, it can only be assigned once. You cannot monitor two pressures 
labelled “ICP” at the same time. If you need to use two identical pressures, you must assign different 
labels to them, for example, P and ICP. 
Measurement labels are stored in the measurement device (module or measurement server). If you try 
to use two measurement devices that have identical labels, this causes a label conflict in the monitor. 
Depending on your configuration, the monitor will either 
• resolve the conflict automatically, by assigning a new, generic label 
to the most recently connected conflicting label (e.g. a second FAP 
label could be changed to ABP)
• display the Measurement Selection window automatically 
for you to resolve the conflict
• take no action, you must enter the Measurement 
Selection window and resolve the conflict
All the currently available measurement devices are depicted in the Measurement Selection 
window. Any measurement labels causing a label conflict are shown in red. If a measurement device is 
connected but currently unavailable, for example, because it was deactivated due to a label conflict, the 
device is shown “grayed-out”.
To resolve a label conflict,

Getting Started
Once you understand the basic operation principles, you can get ready for monitoring.
Inspecting the Monitor
WARNING If the monitor is mechanically damaged, or if it is not working properly, do not use it for any 
monitoring procedure on a patient. Contact your service personnel. 
1 Before you start to make measurements, carry out the following checks on the monitor including 
all connected Measurement Servers, modules, or measurement server extensions. 
– Check for any mechanical damage.
– Check all the external cables, plug-ins and accessories.
2 Plug the power cord into the AC power source. If you are using battery power, ensure that the 
battery has sufficient power for monitoring. When you use a battery for the first time, you must 
charge it, following the instructions given in the section on Charging Batteries.
3 Check all the functions of the instrument that you need to monitor the patient, and ensure that the 
instrument is in good working order.
Switching On
♦ Press the on/off switch on the monitor for one second. The monitor performs a self test and is then 
ready to use. If you see a message such as CO2 Sensor Warmup wait until it disappears before 
starting monitoring that measurement. Connected devices usually take their power from the 
monitor. External devices such as gas monitors and those connected via VueLink have their own 
power switches. 
CAUTION When using an MP90 monitor with a D80 Intelligent Display, always switch power on directly at the 
MP90 or at a remote SpeedPoint or remote alarm device directly connected to the MP90.
Setting up the Measurement Servers and Modules
1 Decide which measurements you want to make. 32
Disconnecting from Power 1 Basic Operation2 Connect the required modules, Measurement Servers, or measurement server extensions.
3 Check that you have the correct patient cables and transducers plugged in. The connectors are 
color-coded to the patient cables and transducers for easy identification.
Starting Monitoring 
After you switch on the monitor,
1 Admit your patient to the monitor.
2 Check that the profile, alarm limits, alarm and QRS volumes, patient category and paced status 
and so forth are appropriate for your patient. Change them if necessary. 
3 Refer to the appropriate measurement section for details of how to perform the measurements you 
require.
Disconnecting from Power
The On/Standby switch does not disconnect the monitor from the ac power source. To disconnect, 
unplug the power cable. 
Monitoring After a Power Failure
If the monitor is without power for less than one minute, monitoring will resume with all active 
settings unchanged. If the monitor is without power for more than one minute, the behavior depends 
on your configuration. If Automat. Default is set to Yes, the default profile will be loaded 
when power is restored. If Automat. Default is set to No, all active settings are retained, if power 
is restored within 48 hours. The Automat. Default setting is made in Configuration Mode.
Networked Monitoring
If your monitor is connected to a network, a network symbol is displayed in the upper left corner next 
to the bed label. To see details about the Care Group, the monitoring equipment, and technical 
information about the network,
♦ MP20/MP30/MP40/MP50 - select the monitor info line to enter the Setup menu, then select 
Bed Information.
♦ MP60/MP70/MP80/MP90 - in the monitor info line, select the bed label.
Be aware that some network-based functions may be limited for monitors on wireless networks in 
comparison to those on wired networks. 
Using Remote Applications 
If your monitor is connected to a Philips Application Server, you can access applications hosted 
remotely on the Application Server and display and operate them on the bedside monitor screen. The 
Application Server provides portal technology to allow information access through a web browser, 
terminal emulation, or served applications. The applications available depend on the Application 
Server configuration: see the device documentation for details. A Remote Application window can also 
be embedded in a monitoring Screen. 
To display remote applications on the monitor,33

3Alarms
The alarm information here applies to all measurements. Measurement-specific alarm information is 
discussed in the sections on individual measurements.
The monitor has three alarm levels: red, yellow, and INOP. 
Red and yellow alarms are patient alarms. A red alarm indicates a high priority patient alarm such as a 
potentially life threatening situation (for example, asystole). A yellow alarm indicates a lower priority 
patient alarm (for example, a respiration alarm limit violation). Yellow arrhythmia alarms are specific to 
arrhythmia-related patient conditions (for example, ventricular bigeminy). 
INOPs are technical alarms, they indicate that the monitor cannot measure or detect alarm conditions 
reliably. If an INOP interrupts monitoring and alarm detection (for example, LEADS OFF), the 
monitor places a question mark in place of the measurement numeric and an audible indicator tone 
will be sounded. INOPs without this audible indicator indicate that there may a problem with the 
reliability of the data, but that monitoring is not interrupted. 
Alarms are indicated after the alarm delay time. This is made up of the system delay time plus the 
trigger delay time for the individual measurement. See the specifications section for details.
If more than one alarm is active, the alarm messages are shown in the 
alarm status area in succession. An arrow symbol next to the alarm 
message informs you that more than one message is active. 
The monitor sounds an audible indicator for the highest priority alarm. If more than one alarm 
condition is active in the same measurement, the monitor announces the most severe. Your monitor 
may be configured to increase alarm indicator volume automatically during the time when the alarm is 
not acknowledged. 
↑ ** HR HIGH41
3 Alarms Visual Alarm IndicatorsVisual Alarm Indicators
Alarm message: An alarm message text appears in the alarm status area at the top of the screen 
indicating the source of the alarm. If more than one measurement is in an alarm condition, the message 
changes every two seconds, and has an arrow ( ) at the side. The background color of the alarm 
message matches the alarm priority: red for red alarms, yellow for yellow alarms, and light blue for 
INOPs. The asterisk symbols (*) beside the alarm message match the alarm priority: *** for red alarms, 
** for yellow alarms, * for yellow arrhythmia alarms. INOPs are displayed without asterisks. 
Depending on how your monitor is configured, it may display alarm limit violation messages
• in text form, for example “**SpO2 LOW” or
• in numeric form, for example “**SpO2 94<96”, where the first number shows the maximum 
deviation from the alarm limit, and the second number shows the currently set limit. 
Flashing numeric: The numeric of the measurement in alarm flashes.
Bright alarm limits: If the alarm was triggered by an alarm limit violation, the corresponding alarm 
limit on the monitor screen is shown more brightly.
Alarm lamp: A lamp on the monitor’s front panel flashes. This has the same color as the alarm 
priority. 
Nurse call systems: Alarm conditions are indicated on any device connected to the nurse call relay, if 
configured to do so.
Audible Alarm Indicators 
The audible alarm indicators configured for your monitor depend on which alarm standard applies in 
your hospital. Audible alarm indicator patterns are repeated until you acknowledge the alarm by 
switching it off or pausing it. or until the alarm condition ceases (if audible alarm indication is set to 
non-latching).
WARNING Do not rely exclusively on the audible alarm system for patient monitoring. Adjustment of alarm 
volume to a low level or off during patient monitoring may result in patient danger. Remember that 
the most reliable method of patient monitoring combines close personal surveillance with correct 
operation of monitoring equipment.
Alarm Tone Configuration 
The audible alarm indicators of your monitor are configurable. In the monitor’s Configuration Mode, 
you can:
• increase the alarm volume of unacknowledged alarms at regular intervals
• change the interval between alarm sounds (ISO/IEC Standard 9703-2 alarms only)
• change the base volume of the red and yellow alarm tones and the INOP tones
• change the alarm sound to suit the different alarm standards valid in different countries.42
Audible Alarm Indicators 3 AlarmsTraditional Audible Alarms (HP/Agilent/Philips/Carenet)
• Red alarms: A high pitched sound is repeated once a second. 
• Two-star yellow alarms: A lower pitched sound is repeated every two seconds.
• One-star yellow alarms (arrhythmia alarms): The audible indicator is the same as for yellow alarms, 
but of shorter duration.
• INOPs: an INOP tone is repeated every two seconds.
ISO/IEC Standard 9703-2 Audible Alarms
• Red alarms: A high pitched tone is repeated five times, followed by a pause. 
• Two-star yellow alarms: A lower pitched tone is repeated three times, followed by a pause. 
• One-star yellow alarms (arrhythmia alarms): The audible indicator is the same as for yellow alarms, 
but of shorter duration. 
• INOPs: a lower pitched tone is repeated twice, followed by a pause. 
Changing the Alarm Tone Volume 
♦ The alarm volume symbol at the top right of the monitor screen gives you an 
indication of the current volume. To change the volume, select the volume symbol 
and then select the required volume from the pop-up selection.
♦ If you want to see a numerical indication of the current alarm volume on a scale 
from zero to 10, select the Alarm Volume SmartKey. The volume scale pops up. 
The current setting is indented. To change the setting, select the required number 
on the scale. Any settings that are inactive (“grayed out”) have been disabled in the 
monitor’s Configuration Mode.
When the alarm volume is set to zero (off), the alarm volume symbol reflects this. If you 
switch the alarm volume off, you will not get any audible indication of alarm conditions.
Minimum Volume for No Central Monitoring INOP
If your monitor is connected to an Information Center, and the connection is interrupted, the INOP 
message No Central Monit. will appear within 30 seconds, accompanied by an INOP tone. To 
help ensure that this INOP, and any other active alarm, is not overlooked, the INOP and alarm tones 
may be configured to have a minimum volume. In this case, INOP and alarm tones will sound even if 
the monitor alarm volume is set to zero.
Alarm 43
3 Alarms Acknowledging AlarmsAcknowledging Alarms 
To acknowledge all active alarms and INOPs, select the Silence permanent 
key. This switches off the audible alarm indicators and alarm lamps. Alternatively, 
you can acknowledge alarms by pressing the Silence hardkey on the MMS or 
on the SpeedPoint. The hardkeys follow the behavior configured for the 
permanent key.
A check mark beside the alarm message indicates that the alarm has been 
acknowledged. If the monitor is configured to re-alarm, a dashed check mark will 
be shown.
If the condition that triggered the alarm is still present 
after the alarm has been acknowledged, the alarm message 
stays on the screen with a check mark symbol beside it. 
If the alarm condition is no longer present, all alarm indicators stop and the alarm is reset.
Switching off the alarms for the measurement in alarm, or switching off the measurement itself, also 
stops alarm indication.
Acknowledging Disconnect INOPs
Acknowledging an INOP that results from a disconnected transducer switches off the associated 
measurement. The only exception is ECG/Resp: acknowledging a disconnect INOP for ECG leads 
does not switch off the ECG and Resp measurements. Acknowledging a disconnect INOP at the 
Information Center switches off the audible INOP indicator but does not switch off the measurement. 
Unplugging an MMS or a plug-in module automatically switches off its measurements. 
Alarm Reminder (ReAlarm)
If Alarm Reminder is configured on for your monitor, you will get an audible reminder of alarm 
conditions that remain active after you have acknowledged the alarm. This reminder may take the form 
of a repetition of the alarm tone for a limited time, or an unlimited repetition of the alarm tone (this is 
the same as a new alarm). There is no alarm reminder for INOPs.
In Configuration Mode, you can set the interval between silencing the alarm and sounding the 
reminder tone to one, two, or three minutes. 
Pausing or Switching Off Alarms
If you want to temporarily prevent alarms from sounding, for example while you are moving a patient, 
you can pause alarms. Depending on your monitor configuration, alarms are paused for one, two, or 
three minutes, or infinitely. 
To view the alarm pause setting chosen for your unit, 
1 Select Main Setup -> Alarm Settings
2 Check the Alarms Off setting. 
This setting can only be changed in Configuration Mode.

switches alarms off. 
♦ Or press the Alarms hardkey on the SpeedPoint or Navigation Point. The hardkey 
follows the behavior configured for the permanent key.
To Switch All Alarms Off
You can only switch alarms off permanently if your monitor is configured to allow infinite alarms 
pause and the permanent key is labelled Alarms Off. 
♦ Select the Alarms Off permanent key. 
♦ Or press the Alarms hardkey on the SpeedPoint or Navigation Point. The 
hardkey follows the behavior configured for the permanent key.
Pausing alarms infinitely is the same as switching them off. 
To Switch Individual Measurement Alarms On or Off
1 Select the measurement numeric to enter its setup menu.
2 Select Alarms to toggle between On and Off.
The alarms off symbol is shown beside the measurement numeric. 
While Alarms are Paused or Off
• The red Alarms Paused lamp on the monitor front panel is lit. 
• In the alarm field, the monitor displays the message 
Alarms Paused or Alarms Off, together with 
the alarms paused symbol and the remaining pause 
time in minutes and seconds, or alarms off symbol.
• No alarms are sounded and no alarm messages are 
shown. 
• INOP messages are shown but no INOP tones are 
sounded. 
The only exceptions are the INOPs Battery/Batteries Empty, Battery/
Batteries Malfunction, Batt 1/2 Missing, and NBP Cuff Overpressure. 
These INOPs are sounded even if alarms are paused or off.
• The nurse call relay is not active.
If a disconnect INOP is present and alarms are paused or switched off, the measurement in question is 
switched off.

♦ To manually switch on alarm indication again after a pause, select the permanent key 
Pause Alarms (or Alarms Off ) again. 
Alarm indication starts again automatically after the pause period expires. If the monitor is configured 
to stay paused infinitely, you must select Alarms Off again to restart alarm indication.
Resetting Arrhythmia Alarm Timeouts
♦ To reset the arrhythmia alarm timeout period, select the Alarms Off or Pause Alarms 
permanent key and then reselect it. 
Extending the Alarm Pause Time 
If your monitor has extended alarm pause enabled, you can extend the alarm pause time. Use this to 
prevent alarms being indicated, for example, while you are washing a patient or carrying out a 
procedure. Only extend the alarm pause time when you are sure that clinical personnel are available to 
monitor the patient’s condition closely. 
To extend the alarm pause time to five or 10 minutes, 
1 Select one of the alarm fields. This calls up the Alarm Messages window.
2 Select either the pop-up key Pause Al. 5 min or the pop-up key Pause Al. 10 min. 
Each time you select one of these pop-up keys, the Alarm Pause Time is reset to five (or 10) 
minutes.
Alarm Limits
The alarm limits you set determine the conditions that trigger yellow and red limit alarms. For some 
measurements (for example, BIS and SpO2), where the value ranges from 100 to 0, setting the high 
alarm limit to 100 switches the high alarm off, and setting the low alarm limit to 0 switches it off. In 
these cases, the alarms off symbol is not displayed.
WARNING Be aware that the monitors in your care area may each have different alarm settings, to suit different 
patients. Always check that the alarm settings are appropriate for your patient before you start 
monitoring.
Viewing Individual Alarm Limits
You can usually see the alarm limits set for each measurement next to the 
measurement numeric on the main screen. 
If your monitor is not configured to show the alarm limits next to the numeric, 
you can see them in the appropriate measurement setup menu. Select the 
measurement numeric to enter the menu and check the limits.

Alarm Limits 3 AlarmsIf you set the yellow alarm limit outside the red alarm limit, the monitor will automatically set the red 
alarm to the yellow alarm limit. 
When an ST measurement is in the Change Limits window there are also two pop-up keys 
available labeled All ST Narrow/All ST Wide. With these keys you can set Auto Limits for all 
ST Leads.
About Automatic Alarm Limits (AutoLimits)
The monitor can automatically set alarm limits suited to your individual patient, using the Automatic 
Alarm Limits function. This tells the monitor to adapt the alarm limits of selected measurements to the 
measured vital signs within a defined safe limit. The monitor calculates safe AutoLimits for each 
patient based on the measured values from the last 12 seconds. 
The defined safe limits never exceed the non-pathological range. 
Limits Narrow sets limits close to the currently measured values for situations where it is critical 
for you to be informed about small changes in your patient’s vital signs.
Limits Wide sets limits further away from the currently measured values for situations where small 
changes are not so critical. 
♦ Use the keys in the Change Limits window to apply AutoLimits for individual measurements. 
These keys are not available if AutoLimits have been disabled for the measurement in the monitor’s 
Configuration Mode. 
AutoLimits are not available for all measurements. The list of measurements for which AutoLimits can 
be used is defined in the monitor’s Configuration mode. 
Use the Change Limits window to check AutoLimits before you apply them to ensure that they are 
appropriate for your individual patient and their clinical condition. Once applied, AutoLimits are 
shown on the monitor screen just like manually-set alarm limits. If the AutoLimits are not appropriate 
for your patient, you must set alarm limits manually. The limits remain unchanged until you set them 
again or change them manually. 
Documenting Alarm Limits

an explanation of the INOP message and, where appropriate, a suggested solution for the problem.
Latching Alarms
The alarm latching setting for your monitor defines how the alarm indicators behave when you do not 
acknowledge them. When alarms are set to non-latching, their indicators end when the alarm 
condition ends. Switching alarm latching on means that visual and/or audible alarm indications are still 
displayed or announced by the monitor after the alarm condition ends. The indication lasts until you 
acknowledge the alarm. 
Viewing the Alarm Latching Settings
To see the alarm latching setting for your monitor 
1 In the monitor’s Main Setup menu, select Alarms.
2 Select Alarm Settings, and see the Visual Latching and Audible Latching 
settings.
This setting can only be changed in Configuration Mode. You should be aware of the settings chosen 
for your unit. There are three possible choices each for visual and audible latching, Red, Red and 
Yellow, and Off. These choices can be combined to give the following settings:

3 Alarms Testing AlarmsAlarm Latching Behavior
All INOPs except DISCONNECT and UNPLUGGED INOPs from measurement servers and modules 
are non-latching. See “Yellow Arrhythmia Alarms” on page 113 for information on short yellow 
arrhythmia alarms latching behavior. 
Testing Alarms
When you switch the monitor on, a selftest is started. You must check that the alarms lamps light, one 
after the other, and that you hear a single tone. This indicates that the visible and audible alarm 
indicators are functioning correctly. For further testing of indidual measurement alarms, perform the 
measurement on yourself (for example SpO2 or CO2) or use a simulator. Adjust alarm limits and check 
that appropriate alarm behavior is observed.
Alarm Behavior at On/Off
When you switch alarms on, the settings defined in the currently active Profile are used. 
If the monitor is switched off for longer than one minute and then switched on again, or after a loss of 
power lasting longer than one minute, or when a patient is discharged, the monitor can be configured 
to restore either the alarm settings from the monitor's configured default Profile, or the most recently 
used alarm settings. After any of these situations, you should check that the alarm settings are 
appropriate for your patient, and if necessary, select the correct Profile and patient category. 
If power is lost for less than one minute, the alarm settings prior to the power loss are restored.

CANNOT ANALYZE ECG ECG/
Arrhythmia
The arrhythmia algorithm cannot reliably analyze the ECG 
data. Check the ECG signal quality of the selected primary and 
secondary leads. If necessary, improve lead position or reduce 
patient motion.
If you have arrhythmia analysis on, and you are not getting a 
reliable HR because the signal is below a minimum amplitude, 
unstable, or contains artifact, and you have tried to improve the 
system performance by choosing another lead and changing 
electrodes, you should consider turning arrhythmia analysis off. 
CANNOT ANALYZE ST ST The ST algorithm cannot generate a valid ST value. Possible 
causes are large variations in the measured ST values for 
consecutive beats, or ventricular paced beats. Review the ECG 
signal quality and the ST measurement points. 
If the patient has a ventricular pacemaker, ST analysis is not 
possible.

5Managing Patients
Use the Patient Demographics window and its associated pop-up keys to admit, discharge, and transfer 
(ADT) patients. 
All patient demographic and ADT information is shared between the patient monitor and the 
Information Center, for example, patients admitted to the monitor are automatically admitted to a 
connected Information Center. 
Admitting a Patient
The monitor displays physiological data and stores it in the trends as soon as a patient is connected. 
This lets you monitor a patient who is not yet admitted. It is however important to admit patients 
properly so that you can identify your patient on recordings, reports, and networked devices. 
During admission you enter data that the monitor needs for safe and accurate operation. For example, 
the patient category setting determines the algorithm the monitor uses to process and calculate some 
measurements, the safety limits that apply for some measurements, and the alarm limit ranges.
To admit a patient,
1 Select the patient name field or select the 
Admit/Dischrge SmartKey to open the 
Patient Demographics window.
2 Clear any previous patient data by selecting 
the Dischrge Patient or End Case 
pop-up key and then Confirm. 
If you do not discharge the previous patient, 
you will not be able to distinguish data from 
the previous and current patients, for 
example, in the trend database.
3 Select Admit Patient.
4 Enter the patient information: select each 
field and use the on-screen keyboard or 
choose from the pop-up list of alternatives to 
input information. If a conventional 
keyboard or a barcode scanner is connected to the monitor you can use this to enter patient 
information.
– Last name: Enter the patient’s last name (family name), for example Smith.

5 Managing Patients Quick Admitting a Patient– First name: Enter the patient’s first name, for example Joseph.
– MRN: Enter the patient’s medical record number (MRN), for example 12345678.
– Patient Cat: Choose the patient category, either Adult, Pediatric, or Neonatal.
– Paced: Choose Yes or No (You must use “Yes” if your patient has a pacemaker).
– Height: Enter the patient’s height.
– Weight: Enter the patient’s weight.
– BSA: The monitor calculates the body surface area automatically.
– Date Of Birth: Enter the patient’s date of birth. Enter this in the form dd/mm/yyyy.
– Age: The monitor calculates the patient age automatically.
– Gender: Choose Male or Female.
– Notes: Enter any extra information about the patient or treatment.
5 Select Confirm. The patient status changes to admitted.
Patient Category and Paced Status
The patient category setting determines the algorithm the monitor uses to process and calculate some 
measurements, the safety limits that apply for some measurements, and the alarm limit ranges.
The paced setting determines whether the monitor shows pacemaker pulses or not. When Paced is 
set to No, pace pulses are filtered and therefore do not show in the ECG wave.
WARNING Patient Category and Paced status will always contain a value, regardless of whether the 
patient is fully admitted or not. If you do not specify settings for these fields, the monitor uses the 
default settings from the current profile, which might not be correct for your patient.
Patient category Changing the patient category may change the arrhythmia and NBP alarm limits. 
Always check alarm limits to make sure that they are appropriate for your patient.
Paced status For paced patients, you must set Paced to Yes. If it is incorrectly set to No, the monitor 
could mistake a pace pulse for a QRS and fail to alarm during asystole.
Admitting a Centrally-Monitored Patient
You can admit a patient at either the bedside or the Information Center. When you admit a patient, 
the patient’s name appears on the bedside monitor and the Information Center. 
If you do not fill in all patient information required by the Information Center, the Information 
Center may reject the admission. Complete all the required fields and try again to admit the patient. 
Quick Admitting a Patient
Use Quick Admit only if you do not have the time or information to fully admit a patient. Complete 
the rest of the patient demographic details later. If you do not, the patient name will not be written on 
reports and on information stored in the database or sent to an Information Center. 
1 Select the Quick Admit SmartKey.
2 Enter the required data (MRN or Last Name depending on configuration) with the keyboard or a 
barcode scanner.78
Editing Patient Information 5 Managing Patients3 Select Enter.
4 In the confirmation window, select Confirm to discharge the previous patient (if confirmation is 
configured). 
5 Check that patient category and paced status are correct for the new patient.
If the monitor is connected to an Information Center and only the MRN is entered, the patient name 
is set to - - - . The patient name field on the monitor shows Not Admitted and the patient name 
space on printed reports is blank. To fully admit this patient, select Admit Patient again and 
complete all required fields. 
Editing Patient Information
To edit the patient information after a patient has been admitted, select the patient name field on the 
Main Screen to open the Patient Demographics window, and make the required changes.
Discharging a Patient
You should always perform a discharge even if your previous patient was not admitted. A discharge:
– clears the information in the Patient Demographics window 
– erases all patient data (such as trend, event, and calculation data) from the monitor, measurement 
servers and Information Center. This ensures that data from a previous patient are not mixed 
with data from the new patient. 
– resets patient category and paced settings to the settings defined in the default Profile
– resets all monitor and measurement settings as well as the active Screen to the settings defined in 
the default Profile
– discharges the patient from the Information Center. 
When a patient is discharged from the monitor or from an Information Center, all patient data is 
deleted. Make sure that you have printed out any required reports before discharging. Check that a 
functioning local or central printer is available before you use End Case.
To discharge a patient, 
1 Select the patient name field to display the Patient Demographics window and associated 
pop-up keys.
2 Select the pop-up key for either:
– End Case - to print any configured end case reports or vital signs recording, discharge the 
patient and clear the patient database, then enter standby mode. If an End Case SmartKey is 
configured for your monitor, you can also select this instead and then confirm. 
To see which end case reports are set up for your monitor, select Main Setup -> Reports -> 
Auto Reports. For each auto report, if End Case Report is set to On, this report will 
be printed when you select End Case. See the section on AutoReports for information on 
setting up end case reports. 
– Dischrge Patient - to discharge the patient without printing any reports. 79
5 Managing Patients Transferring PatientsTransferring Patients
To save you from having to enter the same patient data multiple times and enable patient transfer 
without loss of data, information can be shared between measurement servers, patient monitors, and 
Information Centers.
– patient demographic information is shared between connected measurement servers, patient 
monitors, and Information Centers
– measurement settings and calibration data can be uploaded from an MMS to a patient monitor, if 
configured 
– trend information can be uploaded from an MMS to a patient monitor, if configured. 
Different sets of patient- and measurement-related data are stored in the monitor and the Multi-
Measurement Server. Understanding this will help you to understand what happens to patient data 
when you transfer patients.
WARNING If the monitor is not battery-powered, you cannot monitor during transport.
Transferring a Centrally-Monitored Patient 
Scenario: A centrally-monitored patient is moved to another monitoring location on the same 
Information Center database server without interrupting the collection of patient trend information.
1 Before you disconnect the MMS from the monitor, select the patient name in the monitor info line 
to enter the Patient Demographics window, then select the Transfer pop-up key. If 
the patient is not admitted or not monitored by an Information Center, the Transfer key is 
inactive (“grayed-out”). 
This step preserves the patient’s demographic data during the transfer. 
2 Remove the MMS and any connected extensions from the monitor. 
3 Connect the MMS to the transfer monitor and monitor your patient during the move.

Data Upload from an MMS 5 Managing Patients4 At the new location, connect the MMS to the monitor. If the monitor detects a patient conflict, 
the patient selection window will be displayed. 
5 Select Continue MMS and Confirm your selection. This re-admits the patient from the 
transfer list to the new monitor, completing the transfer. This will upload the patient 
demographics, and, if configured, the measurement settings and trend data stored in the MMS to 
the receiving monitor. 
6 Verify that the settings for patient category and paced mode are correct. 
If you accidentally transfer a patient, use Re-admit to restore this patient’s data to the Information 
Center. If you are not connected to the network, select Clear Transfer to leave transfer mode.The 
patient data remains in the monitor.
Transferring a Patient with an MMS (no Central Station)
Scenario: A patient is moved to another monitoring location using a transport monitor and re-
admitted at the new monitor.
1 Disconnect the MMS from the original monitor and silence the resulting MMS UNPLUGGED 
INOP. 
If you are sure that the patient will not be returning to this monitor, you should perform a 
discharge or end-case. This prevents data from the next patient accidentally being mixed up with 
your current patient’s data.
2 Connect the MMS to the transport monitor and move the patient. 
3 At the new monitoring location, remove the MMS from the transport monitor and connect it to 
the new monitor.
4 If prompted, re-admit the patient to the new monitor: in the Patient Selection window, 
select Continue MMS to retain the data in the MMS. This will upload the patient 
demographics, and, if configured, the measurement settings and trend data stored in the MMS to 
the monitor. Verify that the settings for patient category and paced mode are correct. 
Data Upload from an MMS
The Multi-Measurement Server stores eight hours of patient trend data at one-minute resolution. It 
also stores patient demographic information and the measurement settings and calibration data for the 
measurements carried out by the MMS and any connected extensions. This data can be uploaded to an 
IntelliVue patient monitor, if your monitor is configured to do so and if at least five minutes of trend 
information is stored in the MMS. 
Your monitor’s data upload settings are defined in Configuration Mode to suit your patient transfer 
use model. 
How data is uploaded to the host monitor depends on the configuration mode settings 
MMS Trend Upload and MMS Settings Upload. 
If there is a patient conflict and you select Continue Monitor, no data will be uploaded from the 
MMS. 81
5 Managing Patients Data Exchange Between Information CentersData Exchange Between Information Centers
You can transfer demographic data and trend data from one IIC to another by selecting Transfer 
on the patient monitor. Trend data is not shared between Information Centers and monitors. 
Resolving Patient Information Mismatch
When you connect an MMS to a monitor, or a monitor to the network, the monitor compares patient 
category, paced status, and a unique patient identification number that is internally stored in both the 
MMS and the monitor. The monitor indicates a mismatch if the information is not identical. 
Depending on your monitor’s configuration, this mismatch may be automatically resolved or you may 
have to resolve it manually. If your monitor is configured to resolve mismatches automatically, 
depending on the configuration, either the monitor or the Multi-Measurement Server data is 
automatically retained.
WARNING USA only When a monitor is connected to an Information Center by the wireless IntelliVue 
Instrument Telemetry interface, the patient data will automatically be merged in the case of a transfer. 
This means there is no patient discharge at the monitor and settings and trend data will be retained. 
You will see a message on the monitor and the Patient Demographics window will automatically 
appear so that you can check the data and change it if necessary.
Manually Resolving Patient Mismatch
The patient mismatch is indicated by question marks (???) beside the questionable fields in the Monitor 
Info Line and in the Patient Demographics window. The monitor displays a message such as 
Different patients in Central and Monitor. The Patient Selection window 
automatically opens so you can decide which patient data to use. You do not have to resolve the 
mismatch immediately, however, the indicators remain until you do. There can be up to three columns 
of data in the Patient Selection window if the patient is different in the Information Center, 
monitor, and MMS.
After you resolve the mismatch, the monitor displays a confirmation window that explains the 
consequences of your choice, telling you where the patient will be continued/discontinued. Confirm 
your choice. The monitor automatically displays the Patient Demographics window after 
confirmation. Verify that the settings shown are correct for the patient.
Gender, date of birth, height, weight, and nursing notes do not generate a mismatch. If these fields are 
different on different devices, the monitor resolves them itself. For example, it may take date of birth 
from the Information Center, whilst taking gender from the MMS. Always check the Patient 
Demographics after combining patients, to ensure that you are satisfied with the results. Change them 
if necessary.
WARNING After resolving a patient mismatch, check that the monitor settings (especially patient category, paced 
status and alarm limits) are correct for the patient.82
Resolving Patient Information Mismatch 5 Managing PatientsPatient Mismatch - If One Set of Patient Data is Correct
♦ If there is a mismatch between an 
Information Center and a monitor, 
choose the data set you want to 
continue using for this patient, 
either:
Continue Central: to continue with 
the patient demographics from the 
Information Center, discharge the 
patient in the monitor, and use the 
default monitor profile.
Continue Monitor: to continue with 
the patient in the monitor and 
discharge the patient in the 
Information Center, permanently 
deleting all data in the Information 
Center.
♦ If there is a mismatch between a 
monitor and a measurement server, 
choose the data set you want to 
continue using for this patient, 
either:
Continue Monitor: to continue with 
the patient demographics, trend 
data, and settings in the monitor. 
This discharges the patient in the 
measurement server, and resets all 
MMS settings to the defaults 
currently active for the monitor. 
Continue MMS: to upload the data 
- patient demographics, trend data 
(if configured), and measurement 
settings (if configured) - stored in the MMS to the monitor. This clears all data in the monitor, 
resets the monitor to the default Profile, and discharges the patient in the monitor. 
Patient Mismatch - If Neither Patient Data Set is Correct
A patient mismatch where neither set of patient data is correct might occur if you connect a new MMS 
to a monitor in order to prepare for a new patient, before you actually start measuring. 
♦ Select New Patient if you are sure that none of the information is correct. This discharges all 
patients, erases all data in both the monitor and MMS, resets all settings to the default Profile, and 
lets you admit a new patient.

5 Managing Patients Care GroupsPatient Mismatch - If Both Patient Data Sets Are Correct
A patient mismatch where both sets of patient data are correct might occur if you admit a new patient 
at the monitor (or Information Center) before the patient arrives at your unit and then connect the 
MMS that was used during the patient transport to the monitor.
♦ Select Same Patient if the patient information is different, but you are sure it is the same 
patient. This merges the demographics and updates them in the Information Center, monitor, and 
MMS, according to this table. Be aware that your monitor may be configured to merge trend data 
from the MMS and the monitor, and to upload measurement settings from the MMS to the 
monitor.
Automatically Resolving Patient Mismatch
Your monitor can be configured to automatically resolve mismatches in one of two ways.
• continue using the patient in the MMS, and delete the old data in the monitor. This is suitable for 
transport monitors. 
• continue with the patient in the monitor, and delete the data in the MMS.
Care Groups
If your monitor is connected to an Information Center, you can group bedside monitors into Care 
Groups. This lets you:
• view information on the monitor screen from another bed in the same or in a different Care Group. 
• be notified of yellow or red alarm conditions at the other beds in the Care Group. 
• see the alarm status of all the beds in the Care Group on each monitor screen.
There are two main types of Care Groups:

Care Groups 5 Managing PatientsMonitors must be assigned to these Care Groups at the Information Center. There is a third care group 
which can be assigned locally at the bedside. This is the My Central care group which includes all beds 
(up to 16) from the Information Center your bed is connected to. This care group setting is typically 
used in facilities with only one Information center. The selection of beds is automatic and cannot be 
changed.
The functions available with Care Groups depend on the Information Center revision your monitors 
are connected to. See your Information Center Instructions for Use for further details.

Information Center configuration. 
When an alarm is detected at another bed in the Care Group,
• the alarm status is shown in the Care Group overview bar as an icon.
• a message informing you about the care group alarm is shown in the monitor status line.
• if configured, the Other Bed window, the Alarming Beds window or the My Care Group window 
may pop up on the Screen (if automatic alarm notification is enabled at the bedside monitor and at 
the Information Center). The automatic alarm notification is suppressed when a window, menu or 
pop-up keys are active. 
• if configured, an audible status change notification is issued. The tone type and volume can be 
configured. 88
Care Groups 5 Managing PatientsAutomatic alarm notification can be switched off permanently in the monitor’s Configuration Mode 
or at the Information Center. To temporarily disable and re-enable automatic alarm notification at the 
bedside monitor, for example if you want to carry out a procedure, in Monitoring Mode:
1 Select the network symbol on the monitor screen to call up the Network menu. 
2 Select Auto Window to toggle between the settings Enabled and Disabled. 
This setting resets to the default at discharge and when the monitor is switched on. Always re-enable 
the Auto Window as soon as possible. 
Telemetry Data Overview
You can assign a monitor and a telemetry device to the same patient. This is called “pairing” and is 
done at the Information Center. In paired mode, the telemetry data can be displayed as a permanent 
overview session on the monitor. To do this, one of the available Screens must have the Telemetry 
Data Overview screen element embedded. If configured, this Screen will automatically display when 
the monitor is paired with a telemetry device at the Information Center. Be aware that the data from a 
paired telemetry device is stored at the Information Center and not in the monitor.
Unpairing a Telemetry Device
To disconnect the patient from the telemetry device and reconnect them to the monitor 
(for example, to see realtime waves),
♦ select the Unpair Equipment SmartKey to have the Information Center receive 
the ECG data from the monitor again. In this case data from the telemetry device will 
no longer be monitored at the Information Center. (Behavior depends on the revision of your 
Information Center.)
or 
♦ use the Unpair function at the Information Center. In this case you can decide whether the 
Information Center will continue to monitor data from the telemetry device.89
5 Managing Patients Care GroupsTelemetry Data Overview Screen Element
WARNING Waves and numeric information on the telemetry screen element are delayed for several seconds. If you 
need realtime data, for example for defibrillation, always use the monitor ECG instead of telemetry.
Silencing Telemetry Alarms from the Bedside
When a telemetry device is paired with the monitor, an audible status change notification is issued for 
new telemetry alarms. The volume can be configured. 
If configured, alarms generated from a paired telemetry device can be silenced at the bedside.
To silence telemetry alarms from the bedside,
1 select the telemetry screen element 
2 select the Silence Bed pop-up key
Depending on your configuration, the Silence Bed key may silence both telemetry alarms and 
bedside alarms.
Suspending Telemetry Alarms
When you select Pause Alarms or Alarms Off at the monitor, the alarms are off or paused for 
the bedside measurements.
Refer to the Information Center Instructions for Use for the Suspend/Pause alarms behavior of the 
Information Center and telemetry device. 
Using Standby
When you select Standby mode at the monitor, the bedside goes into Standby mode.

6ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST
Monitoring
The electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electrical activity of the heart and displays it on the 
monitor as a waveform and a numeric. This section also tells you about arrhythmia monitoring (see 
page 107) and ST monitoring (see page 117).
Skin Preparation for Electrode Placement
Good electrode-to-skin contact is important for a good ECG signal, as the skin is a poor conductor of 
electricity.
1 Select sites with intact skin, without impairment of any kind.
2 Clip or shave hair from sites as necessary.
3 Wash sites thoroughly with soap and water, leaving no soap residue. 
We do not recommend using ether or pure alcohol, because this dries the skin and increases the 
resistance.
4 Dry skin thoroughly.
5 Gently abrade the skin using ECG skin preparation paper to remove dead skin cells to improve the 
conductivity of the electrode site.
Connecting ECG Cables
1 Attach the clips or snaps to the electrodes before placing them. If you are not using pre-gelled 
electrodes, apply electrode gel to the electrodes before placement.
2 Place the electrodes on the patient according to the lead placement you have chosen. 
3 Attach the electrode cable to the patient cable.
4 Plug the patient cable into the white ECG 
connector on the measurement server. An ECG 
waveform and numeric appears on the monitor 
display. 
ECG Connector91
6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring Selecting the Primary and Secondary ECG LeadsCAUTION To protect the monitor from damage during defibrillation, for accurate ECG information and to 
protect against noise and other interference, use only ECG electrodes and cables specified by Philips. 
Selecting the Primary and Secondary ECG Leads
The monitor uses the primary and secondary lead to compute HR and to analyze and detect cardiac 
arrhythmias. They are also available for recordings and for display on the Information Center.
The secondary lead setting is used only if your monitor is configured for multi-lead (instead of single-
lead) arrhythmia analysis. It determines which additional lead will be used for arrhythmia analysis.
To select a lead as primary or secondary lead:
♦ In the Setup ECG menu, select Primary Lead or Secondary Lead, then select the 
appropriate lead. You can assign any available lead whether it is currently displayed or not.
Checking Paced Status
It is important to set the paced status correctly when you start monitoring ECG. 
♦ To change the paced status in the Setup ECG menu, select Paced, then select Yes or No.
WARNING Pace pulse rejection must be switched on for paced patients by setting “Paced”  to Yes. Switching pace 
pulse rejection off for paced patients may result in pace pulses being counted as regular QRS 
complexes, which could prevent an asystole alarm from being detected. When changing profiles, and at 
admission/discharge, always check that paced status is correct for the patient.
Some pace pulses can be difficult to reject. When this happens, the pulses are counted as a QRS 
complex, and could result in an incorrect HR and failure to detect cardiac arrest or some arrhythmias. 
Keep pacemaker patients under close observation.
You should choose a lead as primary or secondary lead 
that has the following characteristics: 
• the QRS should be either completely above or below 
the baseline and it should not be biphasic
• the QRS should be tall and narrow
• the P-waves and T-waves should be less than 0.2 mV92
Understanding the ECG Display 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringUnderstanding the ECG Display
Your display may be configured to look slightly different.
ECG numeric: This is derived from the monitored ECG. 
Pace pulse markers: These are shown if the Paced status has been set to Yes and the patient has a 
paced signal.
Defibrillator synchronization marks: If an HP/Agilent/Philips defibrillator is connected, the 
synchronization marks (vertical lines on the ECG wave) are shown on the ECG wave. 
ST numerics in ECG wave: ST numerics can be configured to show underneath the ECG wave on 
the bottom left.
Monitoring Paced Patients
An ECG optimized for monitoring a paced patient should look like this:
You should choose a lead as primary or secondary lead that has these characteristics:
• the normal QRS should be either completely above or below the baseline and it should not be 
biphasic. For paced patients, the QRS complexes should be at least twice the height of pace pulses. 
• the QRS should be tall and narrow
• the P-waves and the T-waves should be less than 0.2 mV.

6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring Changing the Size of the ECG WaveSetting the Paced Status (Pace Pulse Rejection)
Avoiding Pace Pulse Repolarization Tails
Some unipolar pacemakers display pace pulses with repolarization tails. These tails may be counted as 
QRSs in the event of cardiac arrest or other arrhythmias. 
If you note a visible repolarization tail, choose a lead that decreases the size of the repolarization tail.
Changing the Size of the ECG Wave
If any of the displayed ECG waves is too small or clipped, you can change the size of one or all of the 
ECG waves on the screen.
Changing the adjustment factor only changes the visual appearance of the ECG wave on the screen. It 
does not affect the ECG signal analyzed by the monitor.
Comparing the wave size to the 1 mV calibration bar on the ECG wave segment can help you to get an 
idea of the true ECG signal strength. If you choose a fixed adjustment factor, the 1 mV calibration bar 
will be the same size for all the displayed ECG waves. If you choose AutoSize, the calibration bar may 
be a different size for each wave. 
To Change the Size of an Individual ECG Wave
1 Select the wave segment you want to change. This calls up the lead menu for this segment.
2 In the lead menu, select Size Up to increase wave size or Size Down to decrease the size.
Selecting AutoSize lets the monitor choose the optimal adjustment factor for all displayed ECG 
waves.
♦ In the Setup ECG menu, select Paced to toggle between Yes and No. 
You can also change the paced status in the Patient Demographics window. 
When Paced is set to Yes: 
– Pace Pulse Rejection is switched on. This means that pacemaker pulses are 
not counted as extra QRS complexes. 
– pace pulse marks are shown on the ECG wave as a small dash
– the paced symbol is displayed on the main screen.
When Paced is set to No, pacer spikes are not shown in the ECG wave. Be 
aware that switching pace pulse rejection off for paced patients may result in 
pace pulses being counted as regular QRS complexes, which could prevent an 
asystole alarm from being detected.

Changing the Volume of the QRS Tone 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringTo Change the Size of all the ECG Waves 
To change the size of all the ECG waves on the screen by a fixed adjustment factor, 
1 In the Setup ECG Lead menu, select Adjust Size. 
2 Select the required adjustment factor from the line of pop-up keys. 
– Size x0.5 to halve the wave size 
– Size x1 to display the wave without zoom
– Size x2 to double the wave size 
– Size x4: to multiply the wave size by four
– Previous Size: to return one step to the previous size
– Auto Size: to let the monitor choose the optimal adjustment factor for all the ECG waves. 
Changing the Volume of the QRS Tone
The QRS tone is derived from either the HR or Pulse, depending on which is currently selected as the 
alarm source. The QRS volume can be set from 0 to 10 (0 means off). 
♦ To change the QRS volume, in the Setup ECG menu select QRS Volume and then select the 
appropriate volume from the pop-up list.
Changing the ECG Filter Settings
The ECG filter setting defines how ECG waves are smoothed. A letter indicating the filter type is 
shown underneath the lead label on the monitor display. Filter settings do not affect ST measurement. 
12-Lead ECG captures are analyzed in the PIC using the diagnostic filter and displayed on the 
Information Center using the filter setting from the bedside monitor. Any changes you make to the 
filter setting at the bedside monitor may take up to a minute to be reflected at a connected Information 
Center. For this reason, you should wait one minute between changing the filter setting and sending a 
12-lead capture to an Information Center.
♦ To change the filter setting, in the Setup ECG menu, select Filter and then select the 
appropriate setting. 
– Monitor: Use under normal measurement conditions.
– Filter: The filter reduces interference to the signal. It should be used if the signal is distorted 
by high frequency or low frequency interference. High frequency interference usually results in 
large amplitude spikes making the ECG signal look irregular. Low frequency interference usually 
leads to a wandering or rough baseline. In the operating room, the Filter reduces artifacts and 
interference from electrosurgical units. Under normal measurement conditions, selecting 
Filter may suppress the QRS complexes too much and thus interfere with the clinical 
evaluation of the ECG displayed on the monitor. This does not affect the ECG analysis 
performed by the monitor. 
If AutoFilter is set to On in Configuration Mode, the filter setting will automatically be set to 
Filter if electromagnetic interference is detected.95
6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring Choosing EASI or Standard Lead Placement– Diag (Diagnostic): Use when diagnostic quality is required. The unfiltered ECG wave is 
displayed so that changes such as R-wave notching or discrete elevation or depression of the ST 
segments are visible.
The setting Diag selects the highest available ECG bandwidth which is 0.05 to 150 Hz for the 
Adult and 0.5 to 150 Hz for the Pedi and Neo patient category. The term “diagnostic” relates 
only to the ECG bandwidth requirements for diagnostic electrocardiographic devices as 
outlined in the ANSI/AAMI standard EC11-1991. 
Choosing EASI or Standard Lead Placement
If EASI™ monitoring is available on your monitor, you must enable either standard lead placement or 
EASI lead placement. 
♦ In the Setup ECG menu, select Lead Placement and then Standard or EASI. 
EASI is shown beside the 1mV calibration bar on the ECG wave on the display, and EASI is marked 
on any recorder strips and printouts.
See the section on EASI ECG Lead Placement for electrode placement diagrams.
About ECG Leads
To make it possible to compare measured ECG signals, the electrodes (or lead sets) are placed in 
standardized positions, forming so-called “leads.” To obtain ECG signals optimized for use in 
diagnosis and patient management in different care environments, different lead sets in varying lead 
placements can be used. You can use either standard lead placements or EASI lead placements with this 
monitor.
When placing electrodes, choose a flat, non-muscular site where the signal will not be interfered with 
by either movement or bones. Correct lead placement is always important for accurate diagnosis. 
Especially in the precordial leads, which are close to the heart, QRS morphology can be greatly altered 
if an electrode is moved away from its correct location.
ECG Leads Monitored
Changing Lead Sets 
To change the ECG lead set, 
1 Remove the electrodes and then replace them as required. 
2 If the new lead set has more leads than the previous, the monitor automatically recognizes the new 
lead placement. If the new lead set has fewer leads, then you must select New Lead Setup in the 
Setup ECG menu. If you remove electrodes and do not select New Lead Setup, the monitor

ECG Lead Fallback 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoringwill issue a Lead Off INOP message. Select New Lead Setup and the INOP message will 
disappear. 
ECG Lead Fallback
If fallback is configured on and there is a leads off INOP in the primary lead (and in the secondary 
lead, if you are using multi-lead monitoring) for longer than 10 seconds, and if another lead is 
available, this available lead automatically becomes the primary lead. This is known as lead fallback. 
When the Leads Off condition is corrected, the leads are automatically switched back. 
This setting can only be changed in Configuration Mode.

When monitoring 12-leads of ECG, using a 10-Electrode Lead Placement, it is important to correctly 
place electrodes and to label all 12-lead ECG reports with the correct lead placement.
Conventional 12-Lead ECG
In conventional 12-Lead ECG using 10 
electrodes, an electrode is placed on the right 
arm, left arm, right leg, and left leg. Six V- 
electrodes are placed on the chest. The right leg 
electrode is the reference electrode.
Limb electrodes:
– Place arm electrodes on the inside of each 
arm, between the wrist and the elbow.
– Place leg electrodes inside of each calf, 
between the knee and the ankle.
Chest electrodes:
V1 - on the 4th intercostal space at the right 
sternal border

ECG Lead Placements 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringModified 12-Lead ECG
Choosing Standard or Modified Electrode Placement
If your institution uses modified 10 Lead ECG electrode placement (the Mason-Likar Lead System), 
you must switch Mod. Lead Placment to On in the monitor. To do this,
♦ in the Setup ECG menu, select Mod. LeadPlacement to toggle between On and Off. 
– When Mod. Lead Placment is set to On, 12 Lead ECG Reports will be labelled 12 Lead 
ECG Report (Mason-Likar), and captured 12-lead ECGs will be labelled Mason-
Likar to the right of the bandwidth annotation at the Information Center.
– When Mod. LeadPlacment is set to Off, 12 Lead ECG Reports will be labelled 12 
Lead ECG Report, and captured 12-lead ECGs will not be annotated at the Information 
Center.
WARNING Do not use ECG analysis interpretation statements and measurements for 12-lead ECGs obtained 
using the modified (Mason-Likar) limb electrode placement.This may lead to misdiagnosis since the 
modified (Mason-Likar) limb electrode placement does not look the same as the conventional 12-lead 
ECG and may mask inferior infarction due to calculated axis, R, P and T wave magnitudes shifts and 
ST slope. 
Do not export 12-lead ECGs obtained using the modified (Mason-Likar) limb electrode placement. 
Captured 12-Lead ECGs using the modified (Mason-Likar) limb electrode placement exported from 
the Information Center are not annotated with the Mason-Likar label. 
Labelling 12-Lead ECG Reports
To label 12-lead ECG monitor reports and Captured 12-lead ECGs reports:
♦ In the Setup ECG menu, select Mod. LeadPlacement to toggle between On and Off. 
When Mod LeadPlacement is set to On: 
If your institution uses modified 10 
Lead ECG electrode placement (the

Information Center. 
EASI ECG Lead Placement
Using a standard 5-electrode set in EASI lead placement you can monitor up to 12 standard ECG leads 
simultaneously and continuously at the bedside. EASI provides a monitoring method for trending ST 
segment changes that can provide an early indication of ischemia. EASI-derived 12-lead ECGs and 
their measurements are approximations to conventional 12-lead ECGs. As the 12-lead ECG derived 
with EASI is not exactly identical to the 12-lead conventional ECG obtained from an 
electrocardiograph, it should not be used for diagnostic interpretations. 
Respiratory monitoring is also possible with the EASI placement; respiration is measured between the I 
and A electrodes. 
Place the electrodes as accurately as possible to obtain the best quality EASI measurements.
When EASI lead placement is selected, EASI is shown beside the 1mV calibration bar on the ECG 
wave on the display, and EASI is marked on any recorder strips and printouts. 
EASI Monitoring During INOP Conditions If one of the derived EASI leads has an INOP 
condition (for example, LEAD OFF), a flat line is displayed. After 10 seconds, the directly acquired 
EASI AI, AS, or ES lead (depending on which is available) is displayed with the corresponding lead 
label. This causes an arrhythmia relearn.102

Using ECG Alarms 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringUsing ECG Alarms
ECG alarms can be switched on and off and the high and low alarm limits changed just like other 
measurement alarms, as described in the Alarms section. Special alarm features which apply only to 
ECG are described here. 
Extreme Alarm Limits
The extreme rate alarms, Extreme Tachy and Extreme Brady, generated by the active alarm source, 
either HR or Pulse, are set in Configuration Mode by adding a set value to the high and low alarm 
limits. You need to know what value has been configured for your monitor. Changing the high and 
low alarm limits automatically changes the extreme alarm limits within the allowed range.
♦ To see the extreme rate alarms set for your monitor, in the Setup ECG menu, see the menu items 
∆ExtrTachy and ∆ExtrBrady.
ECG Alarms Off Disabled
Be aware that your hospital department may have decided to disable the setting ECG Alarms Off in 
the monitor’s Configuration Mode. In this case, HR alarms cannot be switched off in Monitoring 
Mode. If you try to switch off the HR alarms, you will see the message To activate enter 
Config and enable Alarms Off. 
HR Alarms When Arrhythmia Analysis is Switched Off
When arrhythmia analysis is switched off, only these HR-related alarms will be detected:
• the asystole alarm
• the ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia alarm
• the extreme tachycardia/extreme bradycardia alarms
• the high heart rate/low heart rate alarms.
HR Alarms When Arrhythmia Analysis is Switched On
WARNING When arrhythmia analysis is on, all yellow alarms connected with ECG are short (one-star). This 
means that the yellow alarm lamp and the tones are active for a configured number of seconds only, 
after which the flashing numeric and the alarm message remain for up to three minutes. Alarm 
reminders are not provided for yellow arrhythmia alarms. Red alarms behave as usual.
ECG Safety Information
CAUTION Interference from instruments near the patient and ESU interference can cause problems with the 
ECG wave. See the monitor specifications for more information.105
6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring ECG Safety InformationWARNING Defibrillation and Electrosurgery: Do not touch the patient, or table, or instruments, during 
defibrillation.
After defibrillation, the screen display recovers within 10 seconds if the correct electrodes are used and 
applied in accordance with the manufacturers instructions. 
According to AAMI specifications the peak of the synchronized defibrillator discharge should be 
delivered within 60 ms of the peak of the R wave. The signal at the ECG output on the IntelliVue 
patient monitors is delayed by a maximum of 30 ms. Your biomedical engineer should verify that your 
ECG/Defibrillator combination does not exceed the recommended maximum delay of 60 ms.
When using electrosurgical (ES) equipment, never place ECG electrodes near to the grounding plate of 
the ES device, as this can cause a lot of interference on the ECG signal.
General: When you are connecting the electrodes or the patient cable, make sure that the connectors 
never come into contact with other conductive parts, or with earth. In particular, make sure that all of 
the ECG electrodes are attached to the patient, to prevent them from contacting conductive parts or 
earth.
During surgery: Use the appropriate orange electrode ECG safety cable for measuring ECG in the 
operating room. These cables have extra circuitry to protect the patient from burns during cautery, and 
they decrease electrical interference. These cables cannot be used for measuring respiration.
Pacemaker failure: During complete heart block or pacemaker failure to pace/capture, tall P-waves 
(greater than 1/5 of the average R-wave height) may be erroneously counted by the monitor, resulting 
in missed detection of cardiac arrest.
Patients exhibiting intrinsic rhythm: When monitoring paced patients who exhibit only intrinsic 
rhythm, the monitor may erroneously count pace pulses as QRS complexes when the algorithm first 
encounters them, resulting in missed detection of cardiac arrest.
The risk of missing cardiac arrest may be reduced by monitoring these patients with low heart rate limit 
at or slightly above the basic/demand pacemaker rate. A low heart rate alarm alerts you when the 
patient’s heart rate drops to a level where pacing is needed. Proper detection and classification of the 
paced rhythm can then be determined.
Filtered ECG signal from external instruments: Instruments such as defibrillators or telemetry units 
produce a filtered ECG signal. When this signal is used as an input to the bedside monitor, it is filtered 
again. If this twice-filtered signal is passed to the arrhythmia algorithm, it may cause the algorithm to 
fail to detect pace pulses, pacemaker non-capture, or asystole, thus compromising paced patient 
monitoring performance.
External pacing electrodes: When a pacemaker with external pacing electrodes is being used on a 
patient, arrhythmia monitoring is severely compromised due to the high energy level in the pacer pulse. 
This may result in the arrhythmia algorithm’s failure to detect pacemaker noncapture or asystole.
Fusion beat pacemakers: Pacemakers that create fusion beats (pace pulse on top of the QRS complex) 
cannot be detected by the monitor’s QRS detector.
Rate adaptive pacemakers: Implanted pacemakers which can adapt to the Minute Volume may 
occasionally react on the Impedance measurement used by patient monitors for the determination of 
the Resp value and execute pacing with the maximum programmed rate. Switching off the Resp 
measurement can prevent this. 106
About Arrhythmia Monitoring 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringAbout Arrhythmia Monitoring
Arrhythmia analysis provides information on your patient’s condition, including heart rate, PVC rate, 
rhythm, and ectopics. The monitor uses the user-selected primary and secondary ECG leads for single-
lead or multi-lead arrhythmia analysis. During arrhythmia analysis, the monitor continuously 
• optimizes ECG signal quality. This is important for arrhythmia analysis. The monitor continuously 
filters the ECG signal to remove baseline wander, muscle artifact, and signal irregularities. Also, if 
the Patient Paced status is set to Yes, pace pulses are filtered out to avoid processing them as QRS 
beats.
• detects beats, for example, QRS complexes, identifying them for further analysis.
• measures signal features such as R-wave height, width, and timing.
• creates beat templates, and classifies and labels beats to aid in rhythm analysis and alarm detection.
• examines the ECG signal for ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and noise. 
Arrhythmia Options
Your monitor has either the basic or the enhanced arrhythmia option. Both options provide rhythm 
and ectopic status messages and beat labelling. The number of rhythms being classified, events being 
detected, and alarms generated differs according to the option. The alarms available with the different 
options are listed in the section “ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Alarm Overview” on page 104, the rhythm 
and ectopic messages detected are listed in “Arrhythmia Status Messages” on page 110. 
Where Can I Find More Information? 
See the Application Notes on ST and Arrhythmia supplied on your documentation CD-Rom for 
detailed information on the arrhythmia algorithm and its clinical application.107
6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring Switching Arrhythmia Analysis On and OffSwitching Arrhythmia Analysis On and Off
1 In the Setup Arrhythmia menu, select Arrhythmia to toggle between On and Off. 
2 Select the Confirm pop-up key which appears at the bottom of the screen.
Be aware that when arrhythmia analysis is switched off,
– the message Arrythmia OFF appears beside the ECG wave, if configured to do so
– only the HR-related alarms are detected (the asystole alarm, the ventricular fibrillation/ventricular 
tachycardia alarm, the extreme tachycardia/extreme bradycardia alarms, the high heart rate/ low 
heart rate alarms)
– HR High and HR Low alarms behave like normal yellow alarms, no timeout periods are active.
Choosing an ECG Lead for Arrhythmia Monitoring
It is important to select a suitable lead for arrhythmia monitoring. 
Guidelines for non-paced patients are: 
– QRS should be tall and narrow (recommended amplitude > 0.5 mV) 
– R-Wave should be above or below the baseline (but not bi-phasic) 
– T-wave should be smaller than 1/3 R-wave height 
– the P-wave should be smaller than 1/5 R-wave height.
For paced patients, in addition to the above, the pace pulse should be:
– not wider than the normal QRS
– the QRS complexes should be at least twice the height of pace pulses
– large enough to be detected, with no re-polarization.
To prevent detection of P-waves or baseline noises as QRS complexes, the minimum detection level for 
QRS complexes is set at 0.15 mV, according to AAMI-EC 13 specifications. Adjusting the ECG wave 
size on the monitor display (gain adjustment) does not affect the ECG signal which is used for 
arrhythmia analysis. If the ECG signal is too small, you may get false alarms for pause or asystole. 
Aberrantly-Conducted Beats
As P-waves are not analyzed, it is difficult and sometimes impossible for the monitor to distinguish 
between an aberrantly-conducted supraventricular beat and a ventricular beat. If the aberrant beat 
resembles a ventricular beat, it is classified as ventricular. You should always select a lead where the 
aberrantly-conducted beats have an R-wave that is as narrow as possible to minimize incorrect calls. 
Ventricular beats should look different from these ‘normal beats’. Instead of trying to select two leads 
with a narrow R-wave, it may be easier to just select one lead and use single lead arrhythmia 
monitoring. Extra vigilance is required by the clinician for this type of patient.
Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter
Since P-waves are not analyzed, it is not possible to discriminate atrial rhythms. If there is constant 
variance in the R-R interval, the rhythm is classified as Irregular. It is extremely important for accurate 
analysis of the rhythm to have p-waves with an amplitude of less than 1/5 the height of the R-wave or 
< 0.15 mV. If the p-waves are larger than this, they may be counted as QRS complexes.108
Understanding the Arrhythmia Display 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringIntermittent Bundle Branch Block
Bundle branch and the other fascicular blocks create a challenge for the arrhythmia algorithm. If the 
QRS during the block changes considerably from the learned normal, the blocked beat may be 
incorrectly classified as ventricular, causing false PVC alarms. You should always select a lead where the 
bundle branch block beats have an R-wave that is as narrow as possible to minimize incorrect calls. 
Ventricular beats should look different from these ‘normal beats’. Instead of trying to select two leads 
with a narrow R-wave, it may be easier to just select one lead and use single lead arrhythmia 
monitoring. Extra vigilance is required by the clinician for this type of patient.
Understanding the Arrhythmia Display
Your monitor screen may look slightly different from the illustration. 
Viewing Arrhythmia Waves 
♦ To review arrhythmia beat labels, in the Setup Arrhythmia menu, select Annotate Arrhy. 
The wave showing the primary ECG lead will be delayed by six seconds and shown on a grey 
background. Beat labels will be annotated above the ECG wave and Delayed will be written 
beside it.
♦ To return to the normal ECG primary lead display, select Annotate Arrhy again.

6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring Understanding the Arrhythmia DisplayArrhythmia Status Messages
The monitor displays two types of status messages: 
• Rhythm Status Messages -- to indicate the patient’s rhythm.
• Ectopic Status Messages -- to indicate the presence of ectopic beats.
These status messages are shown on the right hand side of the primary ECG wave. They are updated 
every second, with the exception of the Sinus and Supraventricular (SV) rhythm messages. 
The Sinus and SV rhythm messages are updated based on the current heart rate, taking into account 
the patient category (adult, pediatric, or neonatal). For the message to change from one rhythm status 
to another, the HR must be in the new range for five beats.
If you have basic arrhythmia capability, you will get only messages for the alarms provided with this 
level.
Rhythm Status Messages
The label B or E indicates basic (B) or enhanced (E) arrhythmia capability.

Arrhythmia Relearning 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringEctopic Status Messages
The label B or E indicates basic (B) or enhanced (E) arrhythmia capability.
Arrhythmia Relearning
During a learning phase:
• Alarm timeout periods are cleared
• Stored arrhythmia templates are cleared
• Asystole, Vfib, and HR alarms (when there are enough beats to compute the HR) are active. No other 
alarms are active.
Initiating Arrhythmia Relearning Manually
1 To initiate relearning manually, in the Setup Arrhythmia menu, select Relearn Arrhy.
– While the monitor is learning, the delayed arrhythmia wave displays the beat label L and the 
rhythm status message LEARNING ECG. 
– Next, the monitor determines the dominant rhythm. The beats are labeled N, and the rhythm 
status message changes to LEARNING RHYTHM.
2 After relearning is complete, you should check the delayed arrhythmia wave to ensure that the 
algorithm is labeling the beats correctly. 
3 If beats are still not classified correctly, check that the ECG is optimized for arrhythmia 
monitoring. You may need to select a different lead or change the electrodes or electrode positions 
if there is excessive noise, unstable voltage, low amplitude, or large P- or T-waves. 
Ectopic Status Message Explanation B or E 
(No message displayed) No ectopic activity within the last minute

6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring Arrhythmia AlarmsAutomatic Arrhythmia Relearn 
Arrhythmia relearning is initiated automatically whenever:
• ECG monitoring is switched on
• The ECG Lead or Lead Label is changed manually, or when fallback occurs
• A Leads Off INOP condition (that has been active for > 60 seconds) ends.
If you are monitoring multi-lead arrhythmia and there is a change in one lead only, relearning happens 
only in the affected lead. During this learning phase, the system will continue monitoring using the 
other lead. Therefore, the delayed arrhythmia wave is not labeled L and there is no LEARNING ECG 
rhythm status message. In addition, alarm timeout periods are maintained, stored arrhythmia 
templates are maintained for the operative lead, and all alarms switched on are active.
Arrhythmia Relearn and Lead Fallback
Lead fallback triggers an automatic arrhythmia relearn.
WARNING If arrhythmia learning takes place during ventricular rhythm, the ectopics may be incorrectly learned as 
the normal QRS complex. This may result in missed detection of subsequent events of V-Tach and V-
Fib. 
For this reason you should: 
• take care to initiate arrhythmia relearning only during periods of predominantly normal rhythm and 
when the ECG signal is relatively noise-free
• be aware that arrhythmia relearning can happen automatically
• respond to any INOP messages (for example, if you are prompted to reconnect electrodes)
• be aware that a disconnected EASI electrode triggers an arrhythmia relearn on all leads
• always ensure that the arrhythmia algorithm is labeling beats correctly.
Arrhythmia Alarms 
Arrhythmia alarms can be switched on and off and the settings changed just like other measurement 
alarms, as described in the Alarms section. Special alarm features which apply only to arrhythmia are 
described here. 
The different alarms detected and generated by the monitor depend on the level of arrhythmia analysis 
that is enabled. For a complete list of arrhythmia alarms and INOPs, see the Alarms chapter. 
The monitor detects arrhythmia alarm conditions by comparing ECG data to a set of pre-defined 
criteria. An alarm can be triggered by a rate exceeding a threshold (for example, HR >xx), an abnormal 
rhythm (for example, Ventricular Bigeminy), or an ectopic event (for example, Pair PVCs).112
Arrhythmia Alarms 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringYellow Arrhythmia Alarms
Yellow arrhythmia alarms are short yellow alarms specific to arrhythmia-related patient conditions. 
Depending on your monitor and Information Center revision, they may be shown with one or two 
stars. 
WARNING When arrhythmia analysis is on, all yellow alarms connected with ECG are short (one-star). This 
means that the yellow alarm lamp and the tones are active for a configured number of seconds only, 
after which the blinking numeric and the alarm message remain for up to three minutes. Red alarms 
behave as usual.
Arrhythmia Alarms and Latching 
When using arrhythmia analysis, Visual Latching and Audible Latching should be on 
for red alarms, or at least Visual Latching should be on. Because of the transient nature of 
arrhythmia alarms, many arrhythmia conditions may go unnoticed if alarm latching is off. This setting 
can only be changed in Configuration Mode.
Switching Individual Arrhythmia Alarms On and Off
Some arrhythmia alarms can be individually switched on or off. They are: 
Pacer not capture, Pacer not pace, Non-Sustain VT, Vent Rhythm, Run PVCs, Pair PVCs, R-on-T 
PVCs, V.Bigeminy, V.Trigeminy, Multif.PVCs, Pause, SVT, Irregular HR, Missed Beat, PVCs/min.
♦ To switch individual alarms on or off, in the Setup Arrhythmia menu, select the alarm from 
the list to toggle between On and Off. The monitor displays the INOP message SOME ECG 
ALRMS OFF.
Switching All Yellow Arrhythmia Alarms On or Off
All yellow arrhythmia alarms can be switched on and off together. To do this,
♦ In the Setup Arrhythmia menu, select All Yellow Off or All Yellow On.
Adjusting the Arrhythmia Alarm Limits
Some arrhythmia alarms have limits which can be individually adjusted. They are:
Vtach HR, Vtach Run, PVCs/min, Vent Rhythm, SVT HR, SVT Run, Asystole Thresh., Pause 
Threshold.
1 To adjust alarm limits, in the Setup Arrhythmia menu, select the alarm to be adjusted.
2 Select the appropriate setting from the pop-up list. 
Arrhythmia Alarm Timeout Periods
Normally, an arrhythmia alarm is announced when an alarm condition is detected. However, there are 
certain situations that can inhibit the audible and visible indications of the alarm even though the 
alarm condition was detected. These include: 
• if a more serious alarm condition is active in the same chain
• if a timeout period is in effect for a particular alarm 
• if a timeout period is in effect for a higher alarm in that chain.113
6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring Arrhythmia AlarmsWhat is a Timeout Period?
Timeout periods are automatically started when a yellow arrhythmia alarm is detected. During this 
period, the same alarm condition will not generate another alarm. Alarm conditions further down the 
same arrhythmia alarm chain will also not generate an alarm, but alarms further up the chain will: see 
“Arrhythmia Alarm Chaining” on page 115). 
This setting can only be changed in Configuration Mode.
♦ To view the timeout period configured for your monitor, in the Setup Arrhythmia menu, 
see the menu items TimeOut 1st and TimeOut 2nd.
♦ To reset the timeout period, select the Alarms Off or Pause Alarms permanent key and 
then reselect it. 
Resetting the Timeout Period
Switching alarms off and then on again cancels all visual and audible indicators and resets the timeout 
periods. 
Silencing an alarm cancels all visual and audible indicators, if the alarm condition is no longer present.
How are Yellow Arrhythmia Alarms Indicated?
When a yellow arrhythmia alarm is generated, it triggers visual and audible indicators. 
Behavior of Unsilenced Arrhythmia Alarms
Yellow arrhythmia alarms are always set to latch visually for three minutes. 
Yellow arrhythmia alarms that have not been silenced behave as explained in this table:
Behavior of Silenced Arrhythmia Alarms
If you silence a yellow arrhythmia alarm and the alarm condition still exists, the visual indicators 
continue until the condition stops. You will not get a realarm for the same condition or another 
condition lower down on the same chain until the alarm condition has stopped and reoccurred, and 
the timeout period has expired.
If you silence a yellow arrhythmia alarm and the alarm condition has stopped, the visual indicators 
are immediately cleared. Silencing an alarm does not reset its time out period, so you will not get a 
realarm for the same condition or lower on the chain until the time out expires.

Arrhythmia Alarms 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringArrhythmia Alarm Chaining
When arrhythmia analysis is switched on, multiple alarm conditions may be present. Announcing all of 
the detected alarm conditions would be confusing, and might hide a more serious condition. For this 
reason, arrhythmia alarms are prioritized in three alarm “chains”: PVC Alarms; Beat Detection Alarms, 
and Rate Alarms. 
Only the highest priority alarm condition in each chain is announced. Lower priority alarms in the 
same chain will not be announced while an alarm is active or during the configured timeout period. If 
alarm conditions of equal severity from different chains are detected, the alarm condition that occurred 
most recently is announced. The exception is Irregular HR, which only occurs if no other alarms are 
occurring.
See “ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Alarm Overview” on page 104 for information on which alarms are 
included in the different arrhythmia options. See “Arrhythmia Alarm Timeout Periods” on page 113 
for an explanation of how alarm timeouts work.
– If there is an active Vent Bigeminy alarm, a PVCs > xx/min will not be triggered because it is 
lower on the same chain. However, a high HR alarm will become active because it is on a 
different chain.
– Higher priority alarms supersede previous alarms. For example, if a Vent Trigeminy alarm is active 
and a Pair PVCs occurs, the Pair alarm will be activated.

6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring Arrhythmia AlarmsUnderstanding PVC-Related Alarms
PVC-related alarms are detected on the basis of the current ventricular heart rate and the number of 
consecutive PVCs counted (referred to as PVC Runs). Changing one alarm limit automatically changes 
linked alarm limits.
Example: This diagram illustrates the conditions under which PVC alarms would be generated if the 
Vent Rhythm Run limit is set to 12, the V-Tach Run Limit is set to eight, and the V-Tach HR Limit 
is set to 100. 
You will see that 
• if both the V-Tach Heart Rate Limit and the V-Tach Run Limit are exceeded, a red V-Tach alarm is 
generated
• if the ventricular heart rate exceeds the V-Tach Heart Rate Limit but not the V-Tach Run Limit, a 
yellow Non-Sustain VT alarm is generated.

About ST Monitoring 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringAbout ST Monitoring
The monitor performs ST segment analysis on normal and atrially paced beats and calculates ST 
segment elevations and depressions. This information can be displayed in the form of ST numerics and 
snippets on the monitor. 
All available leads can be monitored continuously. The ECG waveform does not need to be displayed 
on the Screen for ST Segment analysis. 
ST segment monitoring is intended for use with adult patients only and is not clinically validated for 
use with neonatal and pediatric patients. For this reason, the recommended - and default - setting for 
ST monitoring in neonatal and pediatric modes is ST Analysis: Off. 
ST analysis is always performed using a dedicated filter which ensures diagnostic quality. If you are 
monitoring ECG using an ECG filter mode other than Diagnostic, the ST segment of the ECG wave 
may look different from the ST segment of the ST snippet for the same wave. For diagnostic evaluation 
of the ST segment, always switch to Diagnostic filter mode or use the ST snippet.
WARNING Some clinical conditions may make it difficult to achieve reliable ST monitoring, for example: 
• if you are unable to get a lead that is not noisy
• if arrhythmias such as atrial fib/flutter are present, which may cause an irregular baseline
• if the patient is continuously ventricularly paced
• if the patient has left bundle branch block.
You should consider switching ST monitoring off if these conditions are present. 
This monitor provides ST level change information; the clinical significance of the ST level change 
information should be determined by a physician.
Switching ST On and Off
♦ To switch all ST monitoring on or off, in the Setup ST Analysis menu, select ST Analysis 
to toggle between On and Off.
Selecting ST Leads for Analysis
♦ To switch ST monitoring for individual leads on or off, in the Setup ST Analysis menu, 
select Setup ST Leads. In the pop-up window, the leads in the left column under Choices 
are the leads you can choose from, and the leads in the right-hand column Selected are the 
leads chosen to be displayed. Select the ST leads on the left and use the arrow keys to move the 
leads from one list to the other, then select Done to apply the changes. 117
6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring Understanding the ST DisplayUnderstanding the ST Display
Your monitor screen may be configured to look slightly different from the illustrations.
ST Numerics Up to 12 ST numerics plus the 
ST index can be displayed on the monitor 
screen. They can be configured to show beside 
the measurement numerics, beside the ECG 
wave, or beside the ST snippet. 
A positive ST value indicates ST segment 
elevation; a negative value indicates depression.
ST numerics are displayed in the order in 
which you select ST leads for analysis. If there 
is additional space in the field assigned to ST numerics, the monitor will display extra numerics in the 
order in which they appear in the Setup ST Analysis -> Setup ST Leads -> Choices 
list. Any ST leads switched on for analysis that do not fit in the assigned numerics field are shown in 
succession in place of the last ST numeric.
ST Index The ST index numeric (STindx) is the sum of the absolute values for the ST leads V2, V5, 
aVF. Because it is based on absolute values, it is always a positive number. If you haven’t selected one of 
the leads V2, V5, and aVF for ST analysis, the STindx numeric will display a question mark “?”.
♦ To switch the ST index numeric on or off for display, in the Setup ST Analysis menu, 
select ST-Index to toggle between On and Off.
ST Snippets ST snippets show a one second wave segment for each measured ST lead. The most 
recent snippet is drawn in the same color as the ECG wave, usually green, superimposed over the 
stored baseline snippet, drawn in a different color. The comparison shows any deviation in the 
measurement since the baseline snippet was stored, for example as a result of a procedure carried out on 
the patient.
The information is updated once per minute. 
If you do not see ST snippets on the Screen, select the Screen name in the Monitor Info Line and select 
a Screen configured to show snippets from the pop-up list of available Screens. 
ST Baseline Window The ST Baseline Window shows an ST snippet drawn on a grid. The current 
ST numeric and the ST numeric stored with the baseline are shown, as well as the difference between 
these two numerics. 
A “?” in front of the difference numeric indicates that the ST measurement points were adjusted since 
the baseline snippet was stored. 
The Baseline Window opens with the ST pop-up keys Update Baseline, Record ST, 
Change ST Lead, Adjust ST Points, ST Map and arrow keys for scrolling through the 
available leads.

6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring About the ST Measurement PointsAbout the ST Measurement Points
The ST value for each beat complex is the vertical difference between the ISO point and the ST point, 
as shown in the diagram below. The isoelectric (ISO) point provides the baseline, the ST point is at the 
midpoint of the ST segment. The J point is where the QRS complex changes its slope; as it is a fixed 
distance away from the ST point, it can be useful to help you position the ST point correctly. 
CAUTION The ST measurement points need to be adjusted when you start monitoring, and if the patient's heart 
rate or ECG morphology changes significantly, as this may affect the size of the QT interval and thus 
the placement of the ST point. Artifactual ST segment depression or elevation may occur if the 
isoelectric point or the ST point is incorrectly set. 
Always ensure that ST measurement points are appropriate for your patient.
Adjusting ST Measurement Points
Depending on your monitor’s configuration, the ST point can be positioned either 
• relative to the J-point. 
In the Adjust ST Points window, the pop-up keys ISO Point, J Point and ST Point are 
visible and can be adjusted. 
or
• directly. by selecting a numeric value for the ST point. 
In the Adjust ST Points window, you can adjust the ISO and ST point. 
The ST Uses setting can only be changed in Configuration Mode. 
To adjust the ST measurement points, 
1 In the Setup ST Analysis menu, select Adjust ST Points to open the Adjust ST 
Points window. Alternatively, you can use the Adjust ST Points pop-up key in the ST 
Baseline window.
2 Select a suitable ECG lead for ST measurement, with a visible J-point and a visible P wave. Use the 
up and down arrow keys to scroll through the ST snippets for the other ECG leads.

About the ST Measurement Points 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring3 Use the Select Point pop-up key to scroll through the points and activate the point you need 
to adjust, then use the left and right arrow keys to move the measurement point. Each point is 
highlighted while active. 
The ISO-point cursor positions the isoelectric point relative to the R-wave 
peak. The relation is shown beside the ISO-point in milliseconds. Position the 
ISO-point in the middle of the flattest part of the baseline (between the P and 
Q waves or in front of the P wave). 
The J-point cursor positions the J-point relative to the R-wave peak. It helps 
you to correctly position the ST-point. Position the J-point at the end of the 
QRS complex and the beginning of the ST segment. 
The J-point cursor is not available if your monitor is configured to let you set 
the ST point directly. 
To position the ST-point relative to the J-point:
select either J + 60 or J + 80. Select J Point and use the arrow keys 
to move the J-Point and position the ST-point at the midpoint of the ST 
segment. 
To position the ST-point directly: 
select ST Point and use the left and right arrow keys to position the ST 
point at the midpoint of the ST segment.

6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Monitoring ST Alarms5 To update the ST snippet shown in the Adjust ST Points window, select the Update pop-up 
key.
ST Alarms 
ST alarms are yellow alarms. Each ST lead has its own alarm limit. ST alarms are triggered when an ST 
value exceeds its alarm limit for more than one minute. Switching ST alarms off switches off alarms for 
all ST leads. 
If more than one ST measurement is in alarm, the monitor only displays the alarm message of the ST 
lead which is currently furthest from its set alarm limits. 
Single- or Multi-lead ST Alarming
Be aware that if multi-lead ST alarming is switched on, only alarms involving more than one ST lead 
will be announced. 
To choose individual or multi-lead ST alarming,
♦ In the Setup ST Analysis menu, select ST Alarm Mode and select either Single ST or 
Multi ST.
Changing ST Alarm Limits
The monitor can detect alarms on each ST lead separately, so you can set high and low ST alarm limits 
individually for each ST lead. You can also set separate alarm limits for single-lead and multi-lead ST 
monitoring. Set the high and low alarm limits based on your assessment of the patient's clinical 
condition, unit protocols, physician orders or medication specified limits. A good guideline is + 1.0 
mm or - 1.0 mm from the patients's ST, or follow your hospital protocol.
1 In the Setup ST Analysis menu, select ST Alarm Mode and select Single ST or 
Multi ST.
2 Select the alarm to be adjusted.
3 Select the appropriate setting. 
Viewing ST Maps
The monitor can derive a multi-axis portrait (map) from the ST analysis to help you detect changes in 
ST values. It displays two planes obtained from a multilead ECG in a multi-axis diagram, where each 
axis represents a lead. The ST value at the J point is given. The position of the axes within the diagram 
correspond to the placement of the ECG leads. Each ST value is assigned to either a limb lead, or to a 
chest lead. Every axis shows the polarity of the lead it represents. By joining adjacent ST values, the 
monitor obtains the ST map. The contour line, and the map shading, is shown in the same color as the 
ECG parameter. 
Current View
In current view, the monitor displays an ST map that corresponds to the current ST values. Three or 
more leads per plane are necessary to display a map. 
The left of the following diagram shows leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF on the limb leads. On the 
right, the V-leads (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6) are on the chest leads.122
Viewing ST Maps 6 ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST MonitoringIf an ST lead is switched off, its axis is not shown in the map.
If a lead is in INOP (the value is being measured but is invalid or unavailable because, for example, the 
corresponding ECG electrode is unplugged), the area formed by the remaining ST leads is left open.
Trend View
In trend view, you can see up to four trended ST maps, and the current ST map, simultaneously. You 
can configure the time interval between trended samples. The most recent map is shown in the same 
color as the parameter itself. Past values change from white through dark gray. In the diagram below, 
the time interval between trends is 12 seconds. The first trended sample is white and is 12 seconds old. 
The second trended sample corresponds to the ST values 24 seconds ago and so forth. The ST values 
on the diagrams show the current ST values.

7Monitoring Pulse Rate
The pulse numeric counts the arterial pulsations that result from the mechanical activity of the heart in 
beats per minute (bpm). You can display a pulse from any measured SpO2 signal (pleth wave) or any 
arterial pressure (ABP, ART, Ao, BAP, FAP, PAP, UAP, P: see the pressure section for an explanation 
of the pressure labels). The displayed pulse numeric is labeled and color-coded to match its source 
wave. If the pulse numeric is not displayed, see the Setup Pulse menu to check whether it is 
switched on.
Entering the Setup Pulse Menu
If a pulse numeric is displayed on the screen, select it to enter the Setup Pulse (Pulse Source) 
menu. If no pulse numeric is visible, in the Setup SpO2 menu or an Setup arterial pressure menu, 
select Pulse (Pulse Source).
System Pulse Source 
The currently active system pulse source is shown in the setup menus of the pulse source 
measurements. The pulse rate chosen as system pulse:
• is monitored as system pulse and generates alarms when you select pulse as the active alarm source
• is sent via the network to the Information Center, if available
• is trended in the HighRes Trends and stored in the monitor’s databases.
To define which pulse rate is used as system pulse, 
1 In the Setup Pulse menu, select System Pulse.
2 Select one of the SpO2 or arterial pressure labels from the pop-up list, or select Auto. 
If you select Auto, the monitor automatically chooses a pulse rate to be used as system pulse. It 
looks through the list from top to bottom and activates the first pulse rate that is switched on and 
available. 127
7 Monitoring Pulse Rate Switching Pulse On and OffSwitching Pulse On and Off
To switch a particular pulse numeric on or off, enter the Setup Pulse menu via the measurement 
setup menu or wave menu of the pulse source. For example, to switch an SpO2 pulse numeric on or 
off, 
1 Enter the Setup Pulse menu by selecting the Pulse numeric or by selecting Pulse in the 
Setup SpO2 menu.
2 In the Setup Pulse menu, select Pulse (Pulse source) to toggle between On and 
Off.
To switch the system pulse on or off, in any Setup Pulse (Pulse Source) menu, check 
which measurement is currently selected as pulse source. Enter the Setup Pulse menu for this 
pulse source and then switch off the pulse measurement as described. 
Using Pulse Alarms
You can change pulse rate alarm limits in the Setup Pulse menu accessed via any Pulse source, or 
in the Setup ECG menu. Changing the alarm limits for a specific Pulse numeric changes the alarm 
limits for all pulse rate alarms and heart rate alarms.
Pulse alarms are only generated when the active alarm source is set to Pulse and a pulse source is set as 
system pulse. 
Selecting the Active Alarm Source: HR or Pulse?
In most cases the HR and Pulse numerics are identical. In order to avoid simultaneous alarms on HR 
and Pulse, the monitor uses either HR or Pulse as its active alarm source. To change the alarm source, 
select Alarm Source in the Setup ECG or Setup Pulse menu, then select either 
• HR: if you want the HR to be the alarm source for HR/Pulse.
• Pulse: If you select Pulse as the active alarm source, the monitor will prompt you to confirm your 
choice. Be aware that if you select Pulse as the alarm source, all arrhythmia and ECG HR alarms are 
switched off. 
• Auto: If the Alarm Source is set to Auto, the monitor will use the heart rate from the ECG 
measurement as the alarm source whenever the ECG measurement is switched on and no ECG 
LEADS OFF INOP is active. 
The monitor will automatically switch to Pulse as the alarm source if:
– a Pulse source is switched on and available,
and 
– the heart rate becomes unavailable and the ECG LEADS OFF inop is active. 
The monitor then uses the pulse rate from the measurement currently selected as system pulse. 
While Pulse is the alarm source, all arrhythmia and ECG HR alarms are switched off. If the HR 
becomes available again, the monitor automatically uses this as alarm source.128
Using Pulse Alarms 7 Monitoring Pulse RateWARNING Selecting Pulse as the active alarm source for HR/Pulse switches off the arrhythmia alarms listed in the 
section “ECG, Arrhythmia, and ST Alarm Overview” on page 104, and the heart rate alarms. This is 
indicated by the message All ECG Alarms Off (unless this has been configured off for your 
monitor), and the crossed-out alarm symbol beside the ECG heart rate numeric. 
High and low pulse rate and extreme bradycardia and extreme tachycardia alarms from pulse are active. 
Alarm Source Selection Disabled
If Alarm Source Selection is disabled, you cannot change the alarm source. If you try to change the 
source, the monitor displays the message To activate enter Config and enable 
AlarmSourceSel. This setting can only be changed in Configuration Mode.
Changing HR/Pulse Alarm Limits 
As Pulse and HR share the same high and low alarm limits, if you change the alarm limit in the 
Setup Pulse menu, the high or low alarm limits for HR in the Setup ECG menu change 
automatically, and vice versa. The only exceptions are caused by a low limit clamp for each 
measurement: the lowest value for Pulse when derived from SpO2 is 30 bpm; for HR 15 bpm, and for 
Pressure 25 bpm. 
Extreme Alarm Limits
The extreme rate alarms, Extreme Tachy and Extreme Brady, generated by the active alarm source, 
either HR or Pulse, are set in Configuration Mode by adding a set value to the high and low alarm 
limits. You need to know what value has been configured for your monitor. Changing the high and 
low alarm limits automatically changes the extreme alarm limits within the allowed range.
♦ To see the values added to the high and low limit alarms to create the extreme rate alarms for your 
monitor, in the Setup ECG menu, see the menu items ∆ExtrTachy and ∆ExtrBrady.
QRS Tone
The active alarm source is also used as a source for the QRS tone. You can change the tone volume in 
the Setup SpO2 and Setup ECG menus and the QRS tone modulation in the Setup SpO2 menu. 129
7 Monitoring Pulse Rate Using Pulse Alarms130

8Monitoring Respiration Rate
(Resp)
For the respiratory measurement (Resp), the monitor measures the thoracic impedance between two 
ECG electrodes on the patient’s chest. Changes in the impedance due to thoracic movement produce 
the Resp waveform on the monitor screen. The monitor counts the waveform cycles to calculate the 
respiration rate (RR).
Lead Placement for Monitoring Resp
Correct patient skin preparation techniques for electrode placement are important for Resp 
measurement: you will find this information in the chapter on ECG.
The Resp measurement uses the standard ECG cable sets and lead placements. You can use any of the 
different types of ECG cable sets - 3-lead, 5-lead, or 10-lead, using either standard or EASI™ 
placement - to measure Resp, as long as you use ICU ECG cables. 
The Resp signal is always measured between two of the ECG electrodes. If you are using standard ECG 
electrode placement, Resp is measured between the RA and LL electrodes. If you are using EASI™ 
ECG electrode placement, Resp is measured between the I and A electrodes. 
Optimizing Lead Placement for Resp
If you want to measure Resp and you are already measuring ECG, you may need to optimize 
placement of the two electrodes between which Resp will be measured for some patients. Repositioning 
ECG electrodes from standard positions, especially when you are using EASI™ ECG electrode 
placement, results in changes in the ECG waveform and may influence ST and arrhythmia 
interpretation.
Cardiac Overlay
Cardiac activity that affects the Resp waveform is called cardiac overlay. It happens when the Resp 
electrodes pick up impedance changes caused by the rhythmic blood flow. Correct electrode placement 
can help to reduce cardiac overlay: avoid the liver area and the ventricles of the heart in the line 
between the respiratory electrodes. This is particularly important for neonates.131
8 Monitoring Respiration Rate (Resp) Understanding the Resp DisplayLateral Chest Expansion
Abdominal Breathing
Some patients with restricted chest movement breathe mainly abdominally. In these cases, you may 
need to place the left leg electrode on the left abdomen at the point of maximum abdominal expansion 
to optimize the respiratory wave.
Understanding the Resp Display
The Resp measurement is displayed on the monitor as a continuous wave and a numeric respiration 
rate. If the detected respiration rate is close to the heart rate, this is indicated by the text HR = RR next 
to the respiration wave if you are in manual monitoring mode. Your monitor screen may look slightly 
different from the illustration.
Changing Resp Detection Modes
The Resp detection level can be set either automatically or manually. 
♦ To change the resp detection mode, in the Setup Resp menu, select Auto/Manual to toggle 
between the settings. 
Auto Detection Mode
In Auto Detection Mode, the monitor adjusts the detection level automatically, depending on the wave 
height and the presence of cardiac artifact. Note that in Auto Detection Mode, 
• the detection level (a dotted line) is not displayed on the waveform,
Some patients, especially neonates, expand 
their chests laterally. In these cases it is best 
to place the two respiratory electrodes in the 
right midaxillary and left lateral chest areas at 
the patient’s maximum point of breathing 
movement to optimize the respiratory wave.

Changing the Size of the Respiration Wave 8 Monitoring Respiration Rate (Resp)• the algorithm expects a heart rate and therefore needs at least 3 electrodes attached to the patient. If 
you are monitoring respiration with only two electrodes, the detection algorithm becomes less 
sensitive which may result in reduced breath detection performance.
Use Auto Detection Mode for situations where: 
• the respiration rate is not close to the heart rate
• breathing is spontaneous, with or without continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
• patients are ventilated, except patients with Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV).
Manual Detection Mode
In Manual Detection Mode you must set the Resp detection level. 
♦ In the Setup Resp menu, select Manual Up or Manual Down. Use the dotted detection level 
line in the Resp waveform to determine when the desired level is reached.
Once set, the detection level will not adapt automatically to different respiration depths. It is important 
to remember that if the depth of breathing changes, you may need to change the detection level.
Use Manual Detection Mode for situations where:
• the respiration rate and the heart rate are close.
• patients have Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation.
• respiration is weak. Try repositioning the electrodes to improve the signal.
Resp Detection Modes and Cardiac Overlay
In Auto Detection Mode: If you are monitoring Resp and the ECG is switched off, the monitor 
cannot compare the ECG and Resp rates to detect cardiac overlay. The respiration detection level is 
automatically set higher to prevent the detection of cardiac overlay as respiration.
In Manual Detection Mode: Cardiac overlay can in certain situations trigger the respiration counter. 
This may lead to a false indication of a high respiration rate or an undetected apnea condition. If you 
suspect that cardiac overlay is being registered as breathing activity, raise the detection level above the 
zone of cardiac overlay. If the Resp wave is so small that raising the detection level is not possible, you 
may need to optimize the electrode placement as described in the section ”Lateral Chest Expansion”.
Changing the Size of the Respiration Wave
WARNING When monitoring in Manual Detection Mode, make sure to check the respiration detection level after 
you have increased or decreased the size of the respiration wave.
♦ In the Setup Resp menu, select Size Up to increase the size of the wave or Size Down to 
decrease it.133
8 Monitoring Respiration Rate (Resp) Changing the Speed of the Respiration WaveChanging the Speed of the Respiration Wave
Resp waveforms are usually viewed at a slower speed than other waveforms. For this reason, the Resp 
measurement has its own speed control and is not affected by the wave speed settings of the other 
measurements.
♦ Select the Resp wave to enter the Resp Wave menu, then select Change Speed. Choose the 
required speed from the pop-up list. This defines the speed at which the wave is drawn across the 
screen in millimeters per second (mm/s).
Using Resp Alarms
Resp alarms can be switched on and off and the high and low alarm limits can be changed just like 
other measurement alarms, as described in the Alarms chapter. 
Changing the Apnea Alarm Delay
The apnea alarm is a high priority red alarm used to detect apneas. The apnea alarm delay time defines 
the time period between the point where the monitor cannot detect any respiration activity and the 
indication of the apnea alarm. 
1 In the Setup Resp menu, select Apnea Time.
2 Select the appropriate setting.
Resp Safety Information 
WARNING Respiration detection level If you do not set the detection level for the respiration correctly in manual 
detection mode, it may not be possible for the monitor to detect apnea. If you set the detection level 
too low, the monitor is more likely to detect cardiac activity, and to falsely interpret cardiac activity as 
respiratory activity in the case of apnea.
Apnea The respiration measurement does not recognize obstructive and mixed apneas — it only 
indicates an alarm when a pre-adjusted time has elapsed since the last detected breath. 
The safety and effectiveness of the respiration measurement method in the detection of apnea, 
particularly the apnea of prematurity and apnea of infancy, has not been established. 
Interference If operating under conditions according to the EMC Standard EN 60601-1-2 (Radiated 
Immunity 3V/m), field strengths above 1V/m may cause erroneous measurements at various 
frequencies. Therefore it is recommended to avoid the use of electrically radiating equipment in close 
proximity to the respiration measurement unit.
Resp Accessories To monitor respiration, use only the non-OR ECG accessories listed in the Resp 
section of the accessories chapter. You cannot measure respiration if you are using an orange OR ECG 
cable set. This is because of the higher internal impedance of the OR cable set, required for use if 
electro-surgery is being performed.134
Resp Safety Information 8 Monitoring Respiration Rate (Resp)Rate adaptive pacemakers: Implanted pacemakers which can adapt to the Minute Volume may 
occasionally react on the Impedance measurement used by patient monitors for the determination of 
the Resp value and execute pacing with the maximum programmed rate. Switching off the Resp 
measurement can prevent this. 135

9Monitoring SpO2
Philips pulse oximetry uses a motion-tolerant signal processing algorithm, based on Fourier artefact 
suppression technology (FAST). It provides four measurements:
• Oxygen saturation of arterial blood (SpO2) - percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin in relation to the 
sum of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin (functional arterial oxygen saturation).
• Pleth waveform - visual indication of patient’s pulse.
• Pulse rate (derived from pleth wave) - detected pulsations per minute.
• Perfusion indicator - numerical value for the pulsatile portion of the measured signal caused by 
arterial pulsation.
The monitors are also compatible with SpO2 technologies from other manufacturers. Please refer to the 
instructions for use provided with these devices for further information. 
SpO2 Sensors
Depending on the purchased SpO2 option, different sensors and adapter cables can be used. The 
sensors for the different options are color-coded to match the connectors. See the section on 
Accessories for a compatibility table. 
Familiarize yourself with the instructions for use supplied with your sensor before using it. In 
particular, check that the sensor being used is appropriate for your patient category and application 
site.
CAUTION Do not use OxiCliq disposable sensors in a high humidity environment, such as in neonatal incubators 
or in the presence of fluids, which may contaminate sensor and electrical connections causing 
unreliable or intermittent measurements. Do not use disposable sensors on patients who have allergic 
reactions to the adhesive. Always use the MAX-FAST forehead sensor with the foam headband 
provided by Nellcor.
Applying the Sensor
1 Follow the SpO2 sensor’s instructions for use, adhering to all warnings and cautions.
2 Remove colored nail polish from the application site.
3 Apply the sensor to the patient. The application site should match the sensor size so that the sensor 
can neither fall off, nor apply excessive pressure. When using the M1195A Infant Finger Sensor, 137
9 Monitoring SpO2 Connecting SpO2 Cablesselect a finger or toe with a diameter of between 7 and 8 mm (0.27” and 0.31”). When applying a 
M1193A neonatal sensor do not overtighten the strap.
4 Check that the light emitter and the photodetector are directly opposite each other. All light from 
the emitter must pass through the patient’s tissue. 
WARNING Loose Sensor: If a sensor is too loose, it might compromise the optical alignment or fall off. If it is too 
tight, for example because the application site is too large or becomes too large due to edema, excessive 
pressure may be applied. This can result in venous congestion distal from the application site, leading 
to interstitial edema, hypoxemia and tissue malnutrition. Skin irritations or lacerations may occur as a 
result of the sensor being attached to one location for too long. To avoid skin irritations and 
lacerations, periodically inspect the sensor application site and change the application site at least every 
four hours.
Venous Pulsation: Do not apply sensor too tightly as this results in venous pulsation which may 
severely obstruct circulation and lead to inaccurate measurements.
Ambient Temperature: Never apply an SpO2 sensor at ambient temperatures from above 37 
oC 
because this can cause severe burns after prolonged application.
Extremities to Avoid: Avoid placing the sensor on extremities with an arterial catheter, or intravascular 
venous infusion line.
Connecting SpO2 Cables
♦ Connect the sensor cable to the color-coded socket on the 
measurement device (MMS or module). If you are using a 
disposable sensor, plug the sensor into the adapter cable and connect 
this to the measurement device. Connect reusable sensors directly to 
the measurement device.
CAUTION Extension cables: Do not use more than one extension cable (M1941A). Do not use an extension cable 
with Philips reusable sensors or adapter cables with part numbers ending in -L (indicates “long” cable 
version).
Electrical Interference: Position the sensor cable and connector away from power cables, to avoid 
electrical interference.
Humidity: For neonatal patients, make sure that all sensor connectors and adapter cable connectors are 
outside the incubator. The humid atmosphere inside can cause inaccurate measurements.
Measuring SpO2
1 Select the correct patient category setting (adult/pediatric and neonatal), as this is used to optimize 
the calculation of the SpO2 and pulse numerics. 
2 During measurement, ensure that the application site:
– has a pulsatile flow, ideally with a perfusion indicator value above 1.0.
SpO2138
Assessing a Suspicious SpO2 Reading 9 Monitoring SpO2– has not changed in its thickness (for example, due to edema), causing an improper fit of the 
sensor.
WARNING Inspect the application site every two to three hours to ensure skin quality and correct optical 
alignment. If the skin quality changes, move the sensor to another site. Change the application site at 
least every four hours.
Using an SpO2 sensor during MR imaging can cause severe burns. Minimize this risk by positioning 
the cable so that no inductive loops are formed. If the sensor does not appear to be operating properly, 
remove it immediately from the patient. 
CAUTION Injected dyes such as methylene blue, or intravascular dyshemoglobins such as methemoglobin and 
carboxyhemoglobin may lead to inaccurate measurements.
Interference can be caused by:
• High levels of ambient light. (Hint: cover application site with opaque material.)
• Electromagnetic interference.
• Excessive patient movement and vibration.
Assessing a Suspicious SpO2 Reading
Traditionally, pulse rate from SpO2 was compared with heart rate from ECG to confirm the validity of 
the SpO2 reading. With newer algorithms, such as FAST-SpO2, this is no longer a valid criteria 
because the correct calculation of SpO2 is not directly linked to the correct detection of each pulse. 
When pulse rate is very low, or strong arrhythmia is present, the SpO2/Pleth pulse rate may differ from 
the heart rate calculated from ECG but this does not indicate an inaccurate SpO2 value.
If you doubt the measured SpO2, use the pleth wave and perfusion indicator instead to assess the signal 
quality.139
9 Monitoring SpO2 Understanding SpO2 AlarmsUnderstanding SpO2 Alarms
This refers to SpO2 specific alarms. See the Alarms section for general alarm information. SpO2 offers 
high and low limit alarms, and a high priority desat alarm. You cannot set the low alarm limit below 
the desat alarm limit.
CAUTION If you measure SpO2 on a limb that has an inflated NBP cuff, a non-pulsatile SpO2 INOP can occur. 
If the monitor is configured to suppress this alarm there may be a delay of up to 60 seconds in 
indicating critical patient status, such as sudden pulse loss or hypoxia.
Alarm Delays
There is a delay between a physiological event at the measurement site and the corresponding alarm at 
the monitor. This delay has two components:
• The time between the occurrence of the physiological event and when this event is represented by 
the displayed numerical values. This delay depends on the algorithmic processing and the 
configured averaging time. The longer the averaging time configured, the longer the time needed 
until the numerical values reflect the physiological event.
• The time between the displayed numerical values crossing an alarm limit and the alarm indication 
on the monitor. This delay is the combination of the configured alarm delay time plus the general 
system delay time (see “Monitor Performance Specifications” on page 342).
Adjusting the Alarm Limits
In the Setup SpO2 menu:
• Select High Limit then choose the upper alarm limit.
• Select Low Limit then choose the lower alarm limit.
WARNING High oxygen levels may predispose a premature infant to retrolental fibroplasia. If this is a 
consideration do NOT set the high alarm limit to 100%, which is equivalent to switching the alarm 
off. Transcutaneous pO2 monitoring is recommended for premature infants receiving supplemental 
oxygen.
Adjusting the Desat Limit Alarm
The Desat alarm is a high priority (red) alarm notifying you of potentially life threatening drops in 
oxygen saturation. 
1 In the Setup SpO2 menu, select Desat Limit.
2 Adjust the limit.
Pleth Wave
The Pleth wave is autoscaled to maximum display size. It decreases only when the signal quality 
becomes marginal. It is NOT directly proportional to the pulse volume. If you need an indication of 
change in pulse volume, use the perfusion indicator.140
Perfusion (Pleth) Indicator 9 Monitoring SpO2 
Perfusion (Pleth) Indicator
The perfusion indicator gives a numerical value for the pulsatile portion of the measured signal caused 
by the pulsating arterial blood flow.
As pulse oximetry is based on the pulsatile nature of the signal, you can also use the perfusion indicator 
as a quality indicator for the SpO2 measurement. Above 1 is optimal, between 0.3-1 is acceptable. 
Below 0.3 is marginal; reposition the sensor or find a better site.
Setting SpO2/Pleth as Pulse Source
1 In the Setup SpO2 menu, select Pulse (SpO2) to enter the Setup Pulse menu.
2 In the Setup Pulse menu, select System Pulse and select SpO2 from the pop-up list.
Setting Up Tone Modulation
If tone modulation is on, the QRS tone pitch lowers when the SpO2 level drops. Remember, the QRS 
tone is derived from either heart rate or pulse depending on which is currently selected as the active 
alarm source. 
♦ In the Setup SpO2 menu, select Tone Modulation to toggle between Yes (for on) and No 
(for off ).
Tone modulation is licensed under US patent US 4,653,498 from Nellcor Puritan Bennett 
Incorporated, a Tyco Healthcare company.
Setting the QRS Volume
♦ In the Setup SpO2 menu, select QRS Volume and set the appropriate QRS tone volume.
Calculating SpO2 Difference
When a second SpO2 measurement is present (either through the SpO2 module or through VueLink), 
the monitor displays both SpO2 values, and calculates the difference between them. The second value 
is subtracted from the first.

1010Monitoring NBP
This monitor uses the oscillometric method for measuring NBP. In adult and pediatric mode, the 
blood pressure measurements determined with this device comply with the American National 
Standard for Electronic or Automated Sphygmomanometers (ANSI/AAMI SP10-1992) in relation to 
mean error and standard deviation, when compared to intra-arterial or auscultatory measurements 
(depending on the configuration) in a representative patient population. For the auscultatory reference, 
the fifth Korotkoff sound was used to determine the diastolic pressure.
In neonatal mode, the blood pressure measurements determined with this device comply with the 
American National Standard for Electronic or Automated Sphygmomanometers (ANSI/AAMI SP10-
1992) in relation to mean error and standard deviation, when compared to intra-arterial measurements 
in a representative patient population.
The NBP measurement is suitable for use in the presence of electrosurgery and during the discharge of 
a cardiac defibrillator according to IEC 601-2-30/EN 60601-2-30.
A physician must determine the clinical significance of the NBP information.
Introducing the Oscillometric NBP Measurement
Oscillometric devices measure the amplitude of pressure changes in the occluding cuff as the cuff 
deflates from above systolic pressure. The amplitude suddenly increases as the pulse breaks through the 
occlusion in the artery. As the cuff pressure decreases further, the pulsations increase in amplitude, 
reach a maximum (which approximates to the mean pressure), and then diminish.
Studies show that, especially in critical cases (arrhythmia, vasoconstriction, hypertension, shock), 
oscillometric devices are more accurate and consistent than devices using other noninvasive measuring 
techniques.
WARNING Patient Category: Select the correct patient category setting for your patient. Do not apply the higher 
adult inflation, overpressure limits and measurement duration to neonatal patients.
Intravenous infusion: Do not use the NBP cuff on a limb with an intravenous infusion or arterial 
catheter in place. This could cause tissue damage around the catheter when the infusion is slowed or 
blocked during cuff inflation.
Skin Damage: Do not measure NBP on patients with sickle-cell disease or any condition where skin 
damage has occurred or is expected.
Unattended measurement: Use clinical judgement to decide whether to perform frequent unattended 
blood pressure measurements on patients with severe blood clotting disorders because of the risk of 
hematoma in the limb fitted with the cuff.143
10 Monitoring NBP Preparing to Measure NBPCAUTION If you spill liquid onto the equipment or accessories, particularly if there is a chance that it can get 
inside the tubing or the MMS, contact your service personnel.
Measurement Limitations
Measurements are impossible with heart rate extremes of less than 40 bpm or greater than 300 bpm, or 
if the patient is on a heart-lung machine.
The measurement may be inaccurate or impossible:
• if a regular arterial pressure pulse is hard to detect
• with cardiac arrhythmias
• with excessive and continuous patient movement such as shivering or convulsions
• with rapid blood pressure changes
• with severe shock or hypothermia that reduces blood flow to the peripheries
• with obesity, where a thick layer of fat surrounding a limb dampens the oscillations coming from the 
artery
• on an edematous extremity.
Measurement Methods
There are three methods of measuring NBP:
• Manual - measurement on demand.
• Auto - continually repeated measurements (between one and 120 minute adjustable interval).
• STAT - rapid series of measurements over a five minute period, then the monitor returns to the 
previous mode. Use only on supervised patients.
Reference Method
The NBP measurement reference method can be Auscultatory (manual cuff) or Invasive (intra-
arterial). For further information, see the Application Note on NBP supplied on the monitor 
documentation CD-ROM. 
In Adult and Pediatric mode to check the current setting, select Main Setup -> Measurements 
-> NBP, and check whether the Reference setting is set to Auscultatory or Invasive. This 
setting can only be changed in Configuration Mode. 
In Neonatal mode, to comply with safety standards, invasive is always used as the reference method. 
This setting cannot be changed and is not visible in any operating mode.
Preparing to Measure NBP
1 Connect the cuff to the air tubing.
2 Plug the air tubing into the red NBP connector. Avoid compression or restriction of pressure tubes. 
Air must pass unrestricted through the tubing.144
Preparing to Measure NBP 10 Monitoring NBP3 Make sure that you are using a Philips-approved correct sized cuff and that the bladder inside the 
cover is not folded or twisted. 
A wrong cuff size, and a folded or twisted bladder, can cause inaccurate measurements. The width 
of the cuff should be in the range from 37% to 47% of the limb circumference. The inflatable part 
of the cuff should be long enough to encircle at least 80% of the limb.
4 Apply the cuff to a limb at the same level as the patient’s heart. If it is not, you must use the 
measurement correction formula to correct the measurement. 
The marking on the cuff must match the artery location. Do not wrap the cuff too tightly around 
the limb. It may cause discoloration, and ischemia of the extremities. Inspect the application site 
regularly to ensure skin quality and inspect the extremity of the cuffed limb for normal color, 
warmth and sensitivity. If the skin quality changes, or if the extremity circulation is being affected, 
move the cuff to another site or stop the blood pressure measurements immediately. Check more 
frequently when making automatic or stat measurements.
Correcting the Measurement if Limb is not at Heart Level

Understanding the NBP Numerics
Depending on the NBP numeric size, not all elements may be visible. Your monitor may be configured 
to display only the systolic and diastolic values.

Setting up the Pressure Measurement
1 Plug in the pressure cable.
2 Prepare the flush solution.
3 Flush the system to exhaust all air from the tubing. Ensure that the transducer and stopcocks are 
free of air bubbles. 
WARNING If air bubbles appear in the tubing system, flush the system with the infusion solution again. Air 
bubbles may lead to a wrong pressure reading.
4 Connect the pressure line to the patient catheter.
5 If you are using an infusion pressure cuff with the pressure line, attach the pressure cuff to the fluid 
to be infused. Inflate it according to your standard hospital procedure, then start the infusion.
6 Position the transducer so that it is level with the heart, approximately at the level of the 
midaxillary line. 
 MMS Module151
12 Monitoring Invasive Pressure Zeroing the Pressure TransducerWARNING If measuring intracranial pressure (ICP) with a sitting patient, level the transducer with the top of the 
patient’s ear. Incorrect leveling may give incorrect values.
Selecting a Pressure for Monitoring
Tell the monitor which pressure you want to monitor by selecting its pressure label. The label is a 
unique identifier for each type of pressure. When you chose a label, the monitor uses that label’s stored 
color, wave scale and alarm settings.
1 In the Setup <Press> menu, select Label.
2 Select the appropriate label from the list.

Note that if your monitor is connected to an Information Center, the additional labels in the extended 
label set may not be correctly displayed. See the Configuration Guide for your monitor for more 
information. 
Zeroing the Pressure Transducer
To avoid inaccurate pressure readings, the monitor requires a valid zero. Zero the transducer in 
accordance with your hospital policy (at least once per day). You must perform a zero: 
• when you use a new transducer or tubing
• every time you reconnect the transducer cable to the monitor
• if you think the monitor’s pressure readings are not correct.

Zeroing the Pressure Transducer 12 Monitoring Invasive PressureZeroing ICP (or IC1/IC2)
Your hospital guidelines may require you to zero the ICP transducer less frequently than other 
transducers, due to the need for aseptic conditions. When you zero an ICP transducer, the zero values 
are automatically stored and you will not be prompted to repeat the zero procedure. 
If you want to simultaneously zero all pressures except ICP, disconnect the ICP transducer from the 
measurement server or module while zeroing. Reconnecting the transducer recalls the stored values. 
WARNING If you select the label ICP (or IC1/IC2), the measurement device uses the most recently stored zero. 
Therefore, make sure you zeroed the transducer correctly in accordance with the transducer 
manufacturer’s instructions and your hospital policy. When you use a transducer that you cannot 
rezero after placement, ensure that you keep the measuring device with the patient so that you are 
certain you have the correct zero data for this patient.
Determining a Pressure’s Most Recent Zero
The monitor displays the most recent zero on the status line. If this has “timed-out” after you have 
performed a zero, redisplay the information in the status line by entering the pressure’s setup menu.
Zeroing a Pressure Measurement
WARNING Invasive pressure alarms (and pulse alarms, if derived from invasive pressure) are temporarily 
suppressed until 30 seconds after the transducer finishes zeroing.
1 Turn off the stopcock to the patient.
2 Vent the transducer to atmospheric pressure, to compensate for the static and atmospheric pressure 
exerted on the transducer.
3 In the setup menu for the pressure, select Zero <Press>. 
4 When you see the message <Press> zero done at <date and time> on the status line, 
(for example, ABP zero done at 13 Mar 02 23.35) close the stopcock to atmospheric 
pressure, and open the stopcock to the patient.
Using the Zero Hardkey
Pressing the Zero hardkey for two seconds on the M1006B Pressure module starts a zero for the 
pressure currently measured with the module.
Pressing the Zero hardkey for two seconds on the M3001A Multi-Measurement Server zeros the 
pressure being measured by the measurement server and the pressures from any connected 
measurement extensions.
Zeroing All Pressures Simultaneously
WARNING Before zeroing all pressures, make sure that all pressure transducers are vented to atmospheric pressure. 153

receiving controlled mechanical ventilation and mainly free from cardiac arrhythmia.
To select an arterial pressure as PPV source:
1 In the Main Setup menu, select Measurements.
2 In the Setup PPV menu, select ABP, ART, Ao, BAP, P or FAP as the arterial pressure source.
CAUTION Older measurement servers cannot supply a beat-to-beat arterial pressure value. In this case the 
monitor shows a NO PPV FROM <Server> INOP. 
At respiration rates below 8 rpm, PPV calculation may lead to inaccurate values.
Measuring Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure
Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure (PAWP) values, used to assess cardiac function, are affected by:
• Fluid status
• Myocardial contractility
• Valve and pulmonary circulation integrity
Obtain the measurement by introducing a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery flotation catheter into the 
pulmonary artery. When the catheter is in one of the smaller pulmonary arteries, the inflated balloon 
occludes the artery allowing the monitor to record changes in the intrathoraic pressures that occur 
throughout the respiration cycle. The pulmonary wedge pressure is the left ventricular end diastolic 
pressure (preload). 
The most accurate PAWP values are obtained at the end of the respiration cycle when the intrathoraic 
pressure is fairly constant. Use the ECG waveform to determine the waveform of the wedge pressure. 
You can use the respiration waveform as a reference when assessing the PAWP waveform, to ensure 
constant measurement timing relative to the respiratory cycle. The monitor displays the PAWP value 
for up to 48 hours or until you admit a new patient.
WARNING The pressure receptor in the catheter records pressure changes that occur only in front of the 
occlusion. Even though the catheter tip is in the pulmonary artery, the receptor records pressure 
changes transmitted back through the pulmonary circulation from the left side of the heart.
While performing the wedge procedure, the monitor switches off the pressure alarms for pulmonary 
artery pressure (PAP).
Due to a slight measurement delay, you should not use Microstream (sidestream) CO2 as a direct 
reference for determining the end expiratory point in the pressure curve.
To start the Wedge procedure,
1 In the Main Setup menu, select Wedge to display the wedge procedures window.
2 Prepare and check the pressure line according to your hospital policy. If the PAP waveform scale is 
set to Optimum prior to the wedge procedure, it is possible that after wedging the catheter, the 
resulting pressure waveform will fall below the lower scale. In this case, the wedge waveform will 158
Editing the Wedge 12 Monitoring Invasive Pressurenot be displayed or recorded properly. To avoid this, switch out of optimum scale before 
performing a wedge procedure.
3 Use the Reference Wave 1 and 2 popup keys to select any ECG or respiratory wave as 
reference waves.
4 Select Wave Speed if you want to synchronize all displayed waves to your preferred speed.
5 Inflate the balloon when the monitor prompts you: Ready for balloon inflation. The 
waveform changes from the PAP to the PAWP wave. The measurement takes approximately 12 
seconds. On completion, the monitor stores the PAWP waveform display and prompts you to 
deflate the balloon. If the monitor cannot detect a wedging waveform you must use Store 
Trace to store the wedge and two reference waves manually.
6 Deflate the balloon when the monitor prompts you: Ready for balloon deflation and 
verify that the waveform returns to pulmonary artery shape.
7 If you need to start a new measurement, select Restart Wedge.
Editing the Wedge
1 Select the Edit Wedge pop-up key to see the stored waveforms.
2 The monitor displays a cursor in the waveform at the PAWP mean value. It also displays any 
previously stored value and the time it was stored.
3 Move the cursors up, down, right and left to set them on the correct wedge position. 
4 Select Store Wedge to store the PAWP value.
5 Select Print Wedge to print the PAWP waveform and any reference waves or Record Wedge to 
record them. While recording or printing, you cannot perform any more Wedge tasks.
WARNING Prolonged inflation can cause pulmonary hemorrhage, infarction or both. Inflate the balloon for the 
minimum time necessary to get an accurate measurement. 
If the pulmonary artery flotation catheter drifts into the wedge position without inflation of the balloon, the 
pulmonary artery pressure waveform assumes a wedged appearance. Take appropriate action, in accordance 
with standard procedures, to correct the situation.
If the PAWP (mean) is greater than the PAP (systolic), deflate the balloon and report the incident in 
accordance with hospital policy, because the pulmonary artery could be accidently ruptured, and the wedge 
value derived will not reflect the patient’s hemodynamic state, but will merely reflect the pressure in the 
catheter or balloon.159

1313Monitoring Cardiac Output
The Cardiac Output (C.O.) measurement invasively measures cardiac output and other hemodynamic 
parameters using a technique called thermodilution. This can be used to determine the flow rate of a 
system by introducing a cold solution into the system and measuring the resulting drop in temperature 
at a downstream site. The temperature change is displayed as a curve in the C.O. procedure window, 
and the monitor calculates the C.O. value from this curve. The C.O. value is inversely proportional to 
the area under the curve. As cardiac output varies continuously, a series of measurements must be 
carried out to achieve a reliable C.O. average value. Always use the average of multiple thermodilution 
measurements for therapy decisions. 
The measurements can be carried out using the right heart thermodilution method or the PiCCO 
method (transpulmonary thermodilution). 
• The right heart method is available with 
– C.O. module M1012A, standard and option #C10

Measuring C. O. Using the PiCCO Method 
The PiCCO method combines transpulmonary thermodilution and pulse contour analysis on the 
blood pressure waveform. A fluid with a known volume and temperature is injected into the right 
atrium through a CVP catheter. The injectate bolus mixes with the blood in the heart and the change 
in blood temperature is measured with a thermistor at the distal end of an arterial catheter placed in 
one of the bigger systemic arteries, for example, the femoral or the axillary artery.
The PiCCO Method requires a pressure measurement made using either the M1006B Pressure 
module, or a M3001A MMS, or a measurement server extension M3015A, M3014A, or M3012A. (A 
VueLink pressure may not be used.) You will also need a conventional central venous (CVP) line and 
an arterial catheter from Pulsion Medical Systems. You must use the approved catheters and puncture 
locations.
Measuring Continuous Cardiac Output
Every time C.O. is measured with the PiCCO method, the monitor uses this C.O. value and the result 
of the pulse contour analysis to calculate a patient-specific calibration factor. The monitor uses this 
value to compute CCO and the other continuous hemodynamic parameters. CCO values are 
calculated on a beat-to-beat basis and then averaged over a 12-second time frame. The calculated values 
are displayed as numerics on the monitor screen. 
Measuring Systemic Vascular Resistance
The monitor uses CCO, an arterial pressure, and CVP to calculate a continuous SVR value. If a 
continuously measured CVP value is not available, the monitor uses a preset, static CVP value to 
calculate the SVR (you will see the INOP message SVR SET CVP USED). If the BSA is available, the 
monitor uses the CCI to calculate the SVRI. 
SVR/SVRI settings can be changed in the Setup SVR/SVRI menu. To enter the menu, select -> 
Main Setup -> Measurements -> SVR or SVRI.
To display a SVR/SVRI numeric on the Screen, select any numeric, then select Change Numeric 
and select SVR or SVRI from the list of available numerics. 164
Measuring C. O. Using the PiCCO Method 13 Monitoring Cardiac OutputSetting Up the PiCCO C.O. Measurement
1 Set up the arterial line using the arterial 
catheter (transpulmonary catheter) and 
the transducer kit from Pulsion Medical 
Systems. It must be placed in one of the 
bigger systemic arteries, for example, the 
femoral or the axillary artery. You must 
use the approved catheters and puncture 
locations.
2 Set up the central venous line. 
3 Connect the injectate temperature probe 
housing to the venous line. 
4 Plug the C.O. interface cable into the 
C.O. module or measurement server 
extension and connect the following 
devices to the C.O. interface cable: 
– Injectate temperature probe
– Thermistor connector
– Remote start switch (if used).
Follow your hospital standards to avoid 
unintentional extraction of the C.O. 
catheter. Secure the cable using the 
mounting clip shipped with each C.O. 
interface cable. You may also find it 
helpful to loop the C.O. interface cable, 
tape the loop, and attach it to the 
undersheet of the patient's bed using a 
safety pin. 
5 If you are measuring CCO, set up the 
pressure measurement now. The CCO measurement requires a minimally dampened invasive 
pressure setup. You must ensure that there are no air bubbles in the pressure line or dome and use 
only specified accessories. 
6 Check that the correct measurement method is selected. 
If a catheter is already connected to the Cardiac Output Interface Cable, the monitor automatically 
recognizes the method used. If not, in the Setup C.O. menu, select Method and then select 
Transpulmonary.
7 Check that the Tinj Probe Type setting in the Setup C.O. menu matches the type of 
injectate temperature probe used. The probe type is usually printed on the plug of the probe. 
To change the probe type, in the Setup C.O. menu, select Tinj Probe Type to call up a list 
of available probes.
– 23001: it is recommended to use this probe with cold injectate
– M1646: this probe can be used with room temperature injectate or with cold injectate.

13 Monitoring Cardiac Output Measuring C. O. Using the PiCCO Method8 Check that the correct arterial catheter constant is selected.
If the catheter is recognized by the monitor, the catheter constant is automatically displayed and 
cannot be changed manually. If it is not recognized, in the C.O. procedure window, select CathCt 
and use the pop-up keypad to enter the correct value. The catheter constant is usually written 
either on the catheter or on the catheter packaging.
9 Make sure that the injectate volume setting matches the injectate volume you will use. To change 
the volume, in the C.O. procedure window, select InjVol and select the correct injectate volume 
from the pop-up list.
If there is a problem with the volume or temperature you have chosen, the monitor will issue a curve 
alert message to inform you of this.
10 If you are measuring CCO or CCI, check that the correct pressure source is selected in the 
Setup CCO menu. The pressure label under CCO from must match the pressure measured with 
the arterial catheter. To change the pressure source, select CCO from to call up a list of available 
pressure labels and select the correct label. 
11 If you are measuring CCO or CCI, verify that the correct alarm source is selected in the menu item 
Alarms From. To change the alarm source, select Alarms From and choose either CCO or CCI.
Performing PiCCO C.O. Measurements
Always wait for the monitor to indicate readiness for the next step before proceeding. 
If you are measuring CCO, all measurements should be conducted within 15 minutes. Older 
measurements “expire” for CCO calibration.
1 Enter the C.O. procedure window. 
2 When you see the message ...Ready for new measurement, start the measurement by 
selecting the pop-up key Start C.O. or pressing the Start hardkey on the C.O. module, or 
pressing the remote start switch. 
3 When you hear the ready tone and see the message ...Stable baseline, inject now!, 
inject the solution into the CVP catheter. 
At the end of the measurement the thermodilution curve, cardiac output, index values, ITBV and 
EVLW values and any curve alerts are displayed and a message will appear “...Wait before 
starting new measurement”. 
4 When you see the ...Ready for new measurement message, repeat the procedure until you 
have completed the measurements you want to perform. You can perform a maximum of 6 
measurements before editing. If you perform more than 6 measurements without rejecting any, the 
oldest will automatically be deleted when a 7th curve is stored. 
Editing PiCCO C.O. Measurements
It is important to identify and reject erroneous trials, as the monitor uses all the measurement trial 
values you do not reject to calculate the averaged cardiac output. 
1 Review the trials. Irregular trials or trials marked with a “?” should be reviewed carefully. Consider 
the similarity of the values and the shape of the C.O. curve. A normal C.O. curve has one smooth 
peak and returns to the temperature baseline level after the peak.
2 Reject unsatisfactory trials: use the Select Trial pop-up key to move between trials, then 
select the Accept Reject pop-up key to accept or reject trials. If you are using a touch screen 166
Measuring C. O. Using the PiCCO Method 13 Monitoring Cardiac Outputyou can accept or reject trials directly by tipping on the trial curve. Discard conspicuously different 
values. The background of rejected trials is red and the background of accepted trials is green. The 
monitor recalculates the average values after you reject or accept trials.
If all values are different from each other, there may be true hemodynamic instability caused, for 
example, by severe cardiac arrhythmia. 
Saving and Calibrating PiCCO C.O. Measurements
When you have finished editing the trials, you must save the results. This closes the measurement 
series, sends the average C.O. numeric to be displayed on the main screen, and stores the averaged 
values in the trends and calculations databases. 
Before the monitor can calculate CCO, you must calibrate the measurement. You should also calibrate 
CCO every eight hours, or if the hemodynamic condition of the patient changes consistently in the 
same direction over 15 minutes, or if there are large or sudden changes in the patient’s condition.
The monitor only uses C.O. measurements from within the last 15 minutes for calibrating CCO.
To save and calibrate, 
♦ In the C.O. procedure window, select the pop-up key Save C.O. & Cal CCO to use the 
averaged C.O. value to calibrate Continuous Cardiac Output (CCO). 
Your monitor may be configured to have two separate pop-up keys, Save C.O. and Cal CCO, 
instead of the combined Save C.O. & Cal CCO.
WARNING CCO calibration is patient-specific. When the C.O. module or measurement server extension is 
plugged in after the patient has changed, make sure that the correct CCO calibration is used. When in 
doubt perform a new CCO calibration first.
CCO Calibration Status Indicators
Each measurement trial is tagged with a calibration status indicator next to its trial number. Reflecting 
the quality of the pressure signal during the thermodilution measurement, this tag indicates each trial’s 
validity to be used in a CCO calibration. 
For a trial to be eligible for calibration, the pressure signal must be continuously available and 
undisturbed starting 30 seconds before the first C.O. measurement of the series.  Do not zero the 
pressure measurement, change the pressure label, or disturb the pressure signal in any other way during 
this time. 
CAL A pressure signal for CCO was available during the measurement (valid for calibration) 
?CAL A disturbed pressure signal for CCO was available during the measurement (valid for 
calibration)
N/A No adequate pressure signal for CCO was available during the measurement (no valid 
calibration data)
EXP This trial is more than 15 minutes older than the most recent trial and has expired for CCO 
calibration (no valid calibration data)167
13 Monitoring Cardiac Output Measuring C.O. Using the Right Heart Thermodilution MethodMeasuring C.O. Using the Right Heart 
Thermodilution Method
In the right heart thermodilution method, a fluid of known volume and temperature is injected into 
the right atrium through the proximal port of a pulmonary artery (PA) (Swan-Ganz) catheter. The 
injectate bolus mixes with the blood in the right ventricle and the change in blood temperature is 
measured with a thermistor at the distal end of the catheter in the pulmonary artery. 
Setting up RH C.O. Measurements
1 Set up the PA line using a PA catheter.
2 Attach the injectate temperature probe 
housing to the PA line. 
3 Plug the C.O. interface cable into the 
C.O. module or measurement server 
extension and connect the following 
devices into the C.O. interface cable:
– injectate temperature probe
– remote start switch (if used). 
Follow your hospital standards to avoid 
unintentional extraction of the C.O. 
catheter. Secure the cable using the 
mounting clip shipped with each C.O. 
interface cable. You may also find it 
helpful to loop the C.O. interface cable, 
tape the loop, and attach it to the 
undersheet of the patient's bed using a 
safety pin. 
4 Plug the thermistor connection cable of 
the PA catheter into the thermistor 
connector.
5 Connect the injectate temperature probe 
to the injectate temperature probe 
housing.
6 Check that the correct measurement 
method is selected. 
If a catheter is already connected to the Cardiac Output Interface Cable, the monitor automatically 
recognizes the method used. If not, in the Setup C.O. menu, select Method and then select 
Right Heart.

Performing RH C.O. Measurements
1 Enter the C.O. procedure window. 
2 When you see the message ...Ready for new measurement, select the pop-up key Start 
C.O. 
3 When you hear a ready tone and see the message ...Inject now!, inject the solution into the 
right atrial port of the Swan-Ganz catheter. The optimal injection rate is 2.5 ml/second. 
At the end of the measurement the thermodilution curve, cardiac output, index values and curve 
alerts (if necessary) are displayed and a message will appear ...Wait before starting new 
measurement. 
4 When you see the ...Ready for new measurement message, repeat the procedure until you 
have completed the measurements you want to perform. You can perform a maximum of six 
measurements before editing. If you perform more than six measurements without rejecting any, 
the oldest will automatically be deleted when a seventh curve is stored. 
Editing and Saving RH C.O. Measurements
It is important to identify and reject erroneous measurements (called “trials”), as the monitor uses all 
the measurement trial values you do not reject to calculate the averaged cardiac output. 
1 Review the trials. Irregular trials or trials marked with a “?” should be reviewed carefully. Consider 
the similarity of the values and the shape of the C.O. curve. A normal C.O. curve has one smooth 
peak and returns to the temperature baseline level after the peak.
2 Reject unsatisfactory trials: use the Select Trial pop-up key to move between trials, then 
select the Accept Reject pop-up key to accept or reject trials. If you are using a touch screen 
you can accept or reject trials directly by tipping on the trial curve. Discard conspicuously different 
values. The background of rejected trials is red and the background of accepted trials is green. The 
monitor recalculates the average values after you reject or accept trials.
If all values are different from each other, there may be true hemodynamic instability caused, for 
example, by severe cardiac arrhythmia. 
3 Save average C.O. values. To close a measurement series, you must save the average values by 
selecting the pop-up key Save C.O. This sends the average C.O. numeric to be displayed on the 
main screen, and stores the averaged values in the trends and calculations databases.
Documenting C.O. Measurements
You can document C.O. measurements on the default printer or recorder. 
1 In the C.O. procedure window, select the pop-up key Print/Record. 169
13 Monitoring Cardiac Output C.O. Injectate Guidelines2 From the pop-up list, choose: 
– Print Results to print the contents of the C.O. procedure window
– Record Results to record the contents of the C.O. procedure window
– Record Trial to send an individual trial curve to the recorder.
C.O. Injectate Guidelines 
The greater the injectate volume and the colder the temperature, the more accurate the measurement. 
Reduced injectate volume or higher injectate temperature may reduce the specified accuracy.
For adult patients, to ensure the greatest measurement accuracy, use a cold injectate (< 8°C) of 10 ml 
volume, if not contra-indicated by the patient's condition. Your choice of injectate volume should be 
based on the injectate temperature and the patient’s cardiac output.
Guidelines for Right Heart Thermodilution C.O. Injectate
If you are using the right heart thermodilution method, the use of injectate with a temperature less 
than 8°C lower than the blood temperature may cause incorrect values for the thermodilution. 
Guidelines for PiCCO C.O. Injectate
If you are using the PiCCO method, the use of injectate with a temperature less than 12°C lower than 
the blood temperature may cause incorrect values for the thermodilution and CCO calibration. 
Injectate Volume, Patient Weight and ETVI Values (PiCCO Only)
When deciding on an injectate volume and temperature, you must consider your patient’s weight and 
extra-vascular thermal volume index (ETVI). 
High ETVI: The dilution of injectate is influenced by extravascular tissue and fluid. The accuracy of 
the PiCCO method may be reduced in patients with high extra-vascular thermal volume index (ETVI) 
values. Use the table below as a guide in selecting the correct injectate temperature. As shown in the 
table, if your patient has an ETVI > 10, you must use cold injectate. 
Weight: Use the table below as a guide in choosing an injectate volume appropriate for the patient 
weight.

C.O./CCO Curve Alert Messages 13 Monitoring Cardiac OutputC.O./CCO Curve Alert Messages
After each measurement trial, the monitor analyzes the thermodilution curve. If the curve appears 
abnormal, a curve alert message appears in the C.O. procedure window. A question mark symbol (“?”) 
may appear next to the cardiac output numeric if any of these messages appear. The curve alert 
messages are not error messages and do not necessarily mean that the measured values are invalid. 
C.O./CCO Curve Alert Messages Possible Causes
Tinj off scale The Tinjectate is out of the range -1°C and 30°C. Cool down or heat 
up the injectate or change the injectate solution and repeat the 
measurement. 
Noisy Baseline A blood temperature baseline drift that could not be compensated 
was detected during the C.O. measurement. Possible causes are: 
- Interference may be caused by a ventilator.
- Interference may be caused by an infusion pump: infusions of 
significant volume through the central line should be paused at least 
30 seconds before the first thermodilution measurement in a series 
and should not recommence until the measurement series is 
completed. 
- Do not administer injections through the central line during a 
measurement series.
- Electrical devices in the vicinity can cause interference: check for 
infusion pumps connected to the central catheter, cables parallel to 
the thermodilution cable, electrocautery. Make sure all devices are 
properly grounded.
- Wait until measurement results are displayed before moving the 
patient or catheter.
- Close the stopcock to the injectate syringe after the injection. 
- Do not rinse the catheter during measurement, to avoid 
temperature fluctuations.
Temperature Baseline 
Drift
May occur if patient is recovering from open heart surgery, or if 
patient was cooled down for surgery and is in the process of regaining 
normal body temperature when the measurement is made.
Small signal, more 
indicator required
The peak of the transpulmonary thermodilution curve was below 
0.1ºC. Increase injectate volume and/or lower injectate temperature.
Injectate Temperature 
too High
The difference between the blood and injectate temperatures is too 
small. The calculated value for C.O. may not be accurate.
High ETVI, use cold 
injectate or greater 
inj. volume
The ETVI value is too high. The accuracy of the transpulmonary 
thermodilution measurement may be reduced. Increase injectate 
volume and/or lower injectate temperature following the guidelines 
given in the section “Guidelines for PiCCO C.O. Injectate” on 
page 170.
Disturbed Injection The injection should be performed quickly and with a steady 
pressure. Shaking, unsteady pressure, or injections that take longer 
than six seconds may cause this message to appear; you should bear 
this in mind if you are using a large injectate volume (> 10 ml).171
13 Monitoring Cardiac Output C.O./CCO Prompt MessagesIf you have followed all of these guidelines, your measurement values should be valid, even if you still 
see a curve alert message. Ensure that at least three subsequent measurements within the current series 
do no differ by more than 15%. If the difference exceeds 15%, use your clinical judgement to 
determine the appropriate intervention. 
C.O./CCO Prompt Messages
Prompt messages appear in the C.O. procedure window if a C.O. measurement trial must be 
terminated.
Check Injectate 
Temperature Probe Type
The recorded Tinj signal is uncharacteristic for the M1646 injectate 
temperature probe. The probe may be defective or an incorrect probe 
type may have been used.
Unsteady Baseline There is a noisy baseline, and thermal baseline drift.

Abnormal Decay Time May be caused by low cardiac output. Calculated value for C.O. may 
not be accurate.
Very Long Curve The decay time of the curve is longer than 15 seconds.
Very Short Curve Decay time of the curve is less than 0.5 seconds. If there is a noisy 
baseline, part of the baseline may have been mistaken for a 
thermodilution curve. Calculated value for C.O. may not be accurate.
Irregular Curve Any combination of curve alert messages.
Delayed Injection Injection is given more than 15 seconds after Start C.O. is 
selected. Calculated value for C.O. may not be accurate.
C.O./CCO Curve Alert Messages Possible Causes
C.O./CCO Prompt Messages Possible Causes
Curve Below Baseline,

13 Monitoring Cardiac Output C.O./CCO Safety InformationCAUTION During the cardiac output measurement procedure the blood temperature alarms are inactive. This is 
indicated by a crossed-out alarm symbol next to the temperature numeric. Making alarms inactive 
during this procedure prevents false alarms. The alarms are automatically reactivated when you have 
completed the measurement procedure. 174
1414Monitoring Carbon Dioxide
Use the CO2 measurement to monitor the patient’s respiratory status and to control patient 
ventilation.
There are two methods for measuring carbon dioxide in the patient’s airway:
• Mainstream measurement uses a CO2 sensor attached to an airway adapter directly inserted into the 
patient’s breathing system. This method is available with the M3014A Capnography Extension and 
the M3016A Mainstream Extension to the M3001A Multi-Measurement Server.
• Sidestream measurement takes a sample of the respiratory gas with a constant sample flow from the 
patient’s airway and analyzes it with a remote CO2 sensor built into the measurement system. Philips 
offers the sidestream CO2 measurement in the M3014A Capnography Extension and the 
Microstream method of sidestream CO2 measurement in the M3015A Microstream CO2 
Measurement Extension.
In both cases, the measurement principle is infrared transmission, where the intensity of infrared light 
passing the respiratory gas is measured with a photo detector. As some of the infrared light is absorbed 
by the CO2 molecules, the amount of light passing the gas probe depends on the concentration of the 
measured CO2. 
When using a wet ventilator circuit, monitor mainstream CO2 if available, in preference to sidestream 
CO2.
The partial pressure is calculated from the gas concentration by multiplying the concentration value 
with the ambient pressure.
The measurement provides:
• a CO2 waveform.
• an end tidal CO2 (etCO2) value: the CO2 value measured at the end of the expiration phase.
• an inspired minimum CO2 (imCO2): the smallest value measured during inspiration.
• an airway respiration rate (awRR): the number of breaths per minute, calculated from the CO2 
waveform.
Depending on the Max Hold setting configured for your monitor, the etCO2 numeric shows either 
the highest CO2 value measured within the configured time period (Max Hold set to 10 sec or 20 
sec) or the etCO2 numeric shows breath-to-breath value (Max Hold set to Off).
Refer to your Gas Module Instructions for Use, if you are using a Gas Module to monitor CO2.175
14 Monitoring Carbon Dioxide Using the Capnography Extension (M3014A)WARNING Correlation: The etCO2 readings do not always correlate closely with paCO2, especially in neonatal 
patients and patients with pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism or inappropriate ventilation.
Pharmaceuticals in aerosols: Do not measure CO2 in the presence of pharmaceuticals in aerosols.
Explosion Hazard: Do not use in the presence of flammable anesthetics, such as a flammable 
anesthetic mixture with air, oxygen or nitrous oxide.Use of the devices in such an environment may 
present an explosion hazard.
Failure of operation: if the measurement extension or a sensor fails to respond as described, do not use 
it until the situation has been corrected by qualified personnel.
Low etCO2 values: Leakages in the breathing system or sampling system may cause the displayed 
etCO2 values to be significantly too low. Always connect all components securely and check for leaks 
according to standard clinical procedures. Displacement of the nasal or combined nasal oral cannulas 
can cause lower than actual etCO2 readings. Even with combined nasal oral cannulas, the etCO2 
readings may be slightly lower than actual in patients breathing through the mouth only.
Using the Capnography Extension (M3014A)
The M3014A Capnography Extension measures partial pressure of carbon dioxide in a patient’s 
expired gas using the mainstream method or the sidestream method. The mainstream CO2 
measurement can be used, with appropriate accessories, with intubated adult, pediatric and neonatal 
patients. The sidestream CO2 measurement can be used, with appropriate accessories, with intubated 
and nonintubated adult, pediatric and infant patients. With intubated patients, a sample of the 
respiratory gas is drawn from the patient’s breathing circuit through an airway adapter and a gas 
sampling tube. With non-intubated patients, the gas sample is drawn through a nasal or oral-nasal 
cannula.
WARNING Altitude Setting: The monitor is not equipped with automatic barometric pressure compensation. 
Before the CO2 measurement is used for the first time, the altitude must be set to the correct value. An 
incorrect altitude setting will result in incorrect CO2 readings. The CO2 readings will typically deviate 
5% for every 1000m difference.
Electrical Shock Hazard: Do not open the measurement extension. Contact with exposed electrical 
components may cause electrical shock. Always turn off and remove power before cleaning the sensor 
or measurement server. Do not use a damaged sensor or one with exposed electrical contacts. Refer 
servicing to qualified service personnel.
CAUTION Use the M3014A measurement extension with Philips approved accessories only. Refer to the 
instructions for use provided with the accessory.
Preparing to Measure Mainstream CO2
You must perform a zero as described in this procedure each time you use a new airway adapter.

between the elbow and the ventilator Y-section.
WARNING To prevent stress on the endotrachial tube, support the sensor and airway adapter.
Position sensor cables and tubing carefully to avoid entanglement or potential strangulation. Do not 
apply excessive tension to any cable.
Replace the airway adapter, if excessive moisture or secretions are observed in the tubing or if the CO2 
waveform changes unexpectedly without a change in patient status. 
To avoid infection, use only sterilized, disinfected or disposable airway adapters. 
Inspect the airway adapters prior to use. Do not use if airway adapter appears to have been damaged or 
broken. Observe airway adapter color coding for patient population.
Preparing to Measure Sidestream CO2 
1 Plug the sensor cable into the monitor’s CO2 input connector. Allow the sensor 
two minutes warm up time
2 Connect the cannula, airway adapter, or sample line as appropriate, to the 
sensor. It will click into place when seated correctly.

14 Monitoring Carbon Dioxide Using the Capnography Extension (M3014A)– expose the sensor to room air and keep it away from all sources of CO2 including the ventilator, 
the patient’s breath and your own.
– In the setup menu for the CO2, select Start Zero Cal. 
– When you see the message Zero done at <date and time> on the status line, the zero 
calibration is finished and you can begin monitoring.
4 For intubated patients requiring an airway adapter: Install the airway adapter at 
the proximal end of the circuit between the elbow and the ventilator Y-
section. 
For intubated patients with an integrated airway adapter in the breathing 
circuit.: Connect the male luer connector on the straight sample line to the 
female port on the airway adapter.
For non-intubated patients: Place the nasal cannula onto the patient.
 For patients prone to mouth breathing use an oral-nasal cannula. Trim the 
oral sampling tip if necessary to fit the patient. It should extend down past the 
teeth and be positioned in the mouth opening. Remove the cannula from the 
patient if the tip needs to be trimmed.
For nasal or oral-nasal cannulas with oxygen delivery, place the cannula on the 
patient as shown then attach the oxygen supply tubing to the oxygen delivery system and set the 
prescribed oxygen flow. 
WARNING Always connect the airway adapter to the sensor before inserting the airway adapter into the breathing 
circuit. In reverse, always remove the airway adapter from the breathing circuit before removing the 
sensor.
CAUTION Always disconnect the cannula, airway adapter or sample line from the sensor when not in use.

Using the Microstream CO2 Extension (M3015A) 14 Monitoring Carbon Dioxide2 To remove the transducer from the 
airway adapter, open the latch and 
pull out the airway adapter.
WARNING To prevent stress on the endotrachial tube, support the transducer and airway adapter.
To avoid infection, use only sterilized airway adapters. 
Using the Microstream CO2 Extension (M3015A)
The M3015A Microstream CO2 Extension measures the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in a 
patient’s expired gas using Microstream technology.
In intubated patients, a sample of the respiratory gas is drawn from the patient’s breathing circuit 
through an airway adapter and a gas sampling tube. In non-intubated patients, the gas sample is drawn 
through a nasal or oral-nasal cannula.
When using the appropriate accessories, you can use the Microstream CO2 measurement with adult, 
pediatric, and neonatal patients.
The M3015A is equipped with an automatic barometric pressure compensation.
Preparing to Measure Microstream CO2 
Use appropriate accessories for:
• the patient type (adult, pediatric or neonatal),
• the ventilation situation (including humidification)
• the duration - short term use, up to 24 hours (typically OR), or long term use (typically ICU). 
All accessories are for single patient use only. 
Using Microstream Accessories
M3015A can be operated with the special Microstream accessories only. Refer to the instructions for 
use provided with the accessory.181
14 Monitoring Carbon Dioxide Using the Microstream CO2 Extension (M3015A)For intubated patient with non-humidified ventilation, you can use a Microstream FilterLine set. For 
humidified ventilation, use a FilterLine H Set.
For non-intubated patients, the gas sample is taken through a Nasal FilterLine, or a Smart CapnoLine 
(which is a combined oral-nasal FilterLine). In parallel to the measurement of the CO2, oxygen (O2) 
may be delivered to the patient to support gas exchange. This is done by using an O2/CO2 FilterLine, 
or a Smart CapnoLine O2 (a combined oral-nasal O2/CO2 FilterLine).
Using the FilterLine and Airway Adapter
1 Attach the female Luer connector to the CO2 inlet connector on the measurement extension by 
pushing the socket cover down and screwing the connector into place.
2 Check that the FilterLine is not kinked.
3 Change the FilterLine if a “CO2 OCCLUSION” INOP appears on the monitor or if the readings 
become extremely erratic. 
Disconnect the FilterLine during suctioning and nebulizing therapies.
For best results change the FilterLines for non-humidified use (with orange connectors) after 24 hours 
of continuous use and the FilterLines H, for humidified use, (with yellow connectors) after 72 hours of 
continuous use. 
CO2 values for non-intubated patients using Microstream accessories will always tend to be lower than 
for intubated patients. If values appear extremely low, check whether the patient is breathing through 
the mouth or whether one nostril is blocked
Removing Exhaust Gases from the System
WARNING Anesthetics: When using the Microstream CO2 measurement on patients who are receiving or have 
recently received anesthetics, connect the outlet to a scavenging system, or to the anesthesia machine/
ventilator, to avoid exposing medical staff to anesthetics.
Use an exhaust tube to remove the sample gas to a scavenging system. Attach it to the Measurement 
Server Extension at the outlet connector.

1515Monitoring Airway Flow,
Volume and Pressure
The M1014A Spirometry Module is designed to be used in combination with Philips-branded airway 
flow sensors and combined CO2/airway flow sensors. It produces a real time wave for flow, volume and 
pressure of respiratory gases together with numerics for analysis of ventilatory mechanics.
The measurement provides:
• Airway flow, airway volume and airway pressure waveform.
• Numerics for:
– respiratory rate
– tidal volume
– minute volume
– PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure)
– PIP (peak inspiration pressure)
– dynamic compliance
– airway resistance
• Numerics for: (only visible in Spirometry Values Window, no alarming, no trending)
– peak inspiratory flow
– peak expiratory flow
– negative inspiratory pressure
– mean airway pressure
– plateau pressure numeric
– I:E ratio
The measurement also provides pressure-volume loops, flow-volume loops and pressure-flow loops. 
Please see the Respiratory Loops chapter for details on loops.
When using combined CO2/Flow sensors you can also perform mainstream capnography with 
intubated adult, pediatric and neonatal patients. See the Measuring CO2 chapter for details on the CO2 
measurement and the Accessories chapter for a list of compatible accessories.
WARNING Electrical Shock Hazard: Do not open the module. Contact with exposed electrical components may 
cause electrical shock. Always turn off and remove power before cleaning the module. Refer servicing 
to qualified service personnel.187

CAUTION Use the M1014A Spirometry Module with Philips approved accessories only. Refer to the instructions 
for use provided with the accessory.
1 Select the appropriate flow sensor. Make sure that you are using the correct sensor for the respective 
patient category. Otherwise accuracy may be reduced.
You can also use combined CO2/flow sensors. Note that the M3014A Capnography Extension is 
required to measure CO2.
2 If you are using a combined CO2/Flow sensor, connect it to the CO2 sensor head first. The airway 
adapter clicks into place when seated correctly.
3 Click the connector into place in the flow sensor receptacle on the monitor before connecting to 
the breathing circuit.
4 Install the flow sensor or the combined CO2/Flow sensor at the proximal end of the breathing 
circuit between the elbow and the ventilator Y-piece. Make sure that the spirometry sensor is in a 
horizontal position with its tubing pointing upwards. The correct position is also indicated by an 
arrow on some of the sensors. (Graphic shows combined CO2/Flow Sensors).

Attaching the Flow Sensor 15 Monitoring Airway Flow, Volume and PressureWARNING To prevent stress on the endotrachial tube, support the sensor and airway adapter.
Position sensor cables and tubing carefully to avoid entanglement or potential strangulation. Do not 
apply excessive tension to any cable or tubing.
Replace the sensor, if excessive moisture or secretions are observed in the tubing and cannot be 
removed by a purge cycle. 
Reuse poses a patient hazard. Do not disassemble, clean, disinfect or sterilize the sensor.
A system leak may significantly affect readings of flow, volume, pressure and other respiratory 
mechanics parameters.
Do not leave the sensor in the patient circuit when not connected to the monitor.
NOTE • Do NOT place the airway adapter between the endotrachial tube and the elbow (pediatric/adult 
circuit), as this may allow patient secretions to block adapter windows.
• The striped tubing of the flow sensor should always be proximal to the patient.
• Position the airway adapter with the spirometry tubing pointing upwards.
• To prevent “rain-out” and moisture from draining into the airway adapter, do NOT place the airway 
adapter in a gravity dependent position.
• Periodically check the flow sensor and tubing for excessive moisture or secretion build up. Perform a 
purge cycle if droplets are visible within the sensor or tubing. Repeat if necessary. If purging does not 
remove the droplets, replace the sensor.
• For routine performance of airway care, separate the system between the endotrachial tube and the 
airway adapter (neonatal circuit), or between the endotracheal tube and elbow (pediatric/adult 
circuit). Lavage and suctioning of the airway can then be performed without fluids and mucous 
accumulating on the airway adapter windows.
• Measurement values provided by a ventilator may differ significantly from the values provided by 
the spirometry module, due to different locations of the flow sensor.
• Incorrect entry of gas compensation parameters (i.e. temperature, gas composition) may reduce the 
accuracy of the measured values.

The zero calibration maintains the accuracy of the spirometry waves and numerics by regularly 
compensating for drifts within the measurement section. It is performed automatically without user 
interaction and takes about 2 seconds to complete. The automatic zero calibration is normally carried 
out every ten minutes. During warm-up or when the ambient pressure changes, this interval may be 
reduced to two minutes.
During the zero calibration the waveform is flat but the numerics remain on the screen. Typically, a 
zero calibration is started at the beginning of a respiration cycle, therefore a waveform may begin 
normally and then immediately become flat for the time of the zero calibration.
Automatic Purging
A double lumen connecting line (tubing) connects the flow sensors to the patient monitor. The 
M1014A Spirometry Module includes an automatic and manual purge feature which provides a flush 
of room air to keep the sensor tubing free from water condensation and patient secretions. This feature 
is available for the adult, pediatric, and neonatal modes. The purge will begin with the exhalation 
portion of the ventilator cycle.
NOTE • During the purge cycle the pump will be heard
• If the purge does not sufficiently clear the flow tubing lines, the flow sensor should be replaced
• With each purge cycle, a zero calibration is automatically performed

Manual Purging 15 Monitoring Airway Flow, Volume and PressureAdult Mode
The system automatically purges the sensor tubing every ten minutes or less, depending on system 
conditions. In adult mode, the system will purge both sides of the line, one at a time, during each 
purge cycle. The higher the pressure, the more frequent the purging. This action anticipates increased 
moisture migration into the sensor tubing due to the increase in circuit pressure.
Neonatal and Pediatric Modes
The automatic purge cycles used in the neonatal or pediatric mode is fixed at every three minutes 
regardless of circuit pressure. Only one side of the sensor tubing will be purged during each purge 
cycle. 
Unlike the adult purge mode, the neonatal or pediatric purge mode does not use the full force of the 
internal pump, but rather pressurizes an internal reservoir which is used for the purge. This minimizes 
the pressure delivered to the ventilator circuit, but does deliver a sufficient pressure to purge the sensor 
tubing.
Manual Purging
Occasionally, purging may be required in between the automatic purge cycles. The manual purge may 
be used as often as needed. Check the orientation of the flow sensor if repeated manual purge cycles 
become necessary.
To manually purge, press the Purge button on the module (marked by  on international 
versions of the module) or select Purge in the Setup Spirometry window to initiate a combined 
purge and zero cycle.
Gas Compensation
Temperature and the proportions of individual gases influence the flow measurement. If values seem 
inaccurately high or low, check that the monitor is using the appropriate gas compensation. Gas 
compensation can be done using either manually entered gas concentrations or gas concentrations 
from the gas analyzer.
NOTE If you unintentionally switch the gas compensation to the incorrect setting, the accuracy of the 
measured flow and volume values may be significantly reduced. The tables below show examples of 
incorrect gas compensation settings and the resulting inaccuracies:

1616Monitoring tcGas
The tcGas module measures the partial pressure of the oxygen and carbon dioxide that diffuses through 
the skin, thereby providing a measure of these gases in the capillary blood.
The monitor’s settings for altitude and barometric pressure influence the measurement. The tcpO2/
tcpCO2 measurement is valid for an infant patient not under gas anesthesia. Anesthetic agents, such as 
halothane, can cause incorrect or drifting readings.
Transcutaneous measurements cannot replace arterial blood gas monitoring. However, you can use 
transcutaneous monitoring to reduce the frequency of arterial sampling. The values at tissue level will 
not be the same as those measured arterially because the measurement is transcutaneous. They correlate 
with (track closely) the arterial values. For example, a drop in transcutaneous values usually indicates a 
corresponding drop in arterial values.
Transcutaneous values will not always correlate with blood samples taken from the capillary blood of 
the heel (heelsticks or astrups).

16 Monitoring tcGas Setting the tcGas Sensor TemperatureSetting the tcGas Sensor Temperature
1 In the Setup tcGas menu, select Transducer Temp.
2 Choose a temperature value appropriate for your patient’s age, weight and physical condition in 
accordance with your hospital policy.
Usually, a higher transducer temperature gives a better correlation and a quicker response time. 
However, higher temperatures also increase the risk of skin burns. Most physicians prefer a 
temperature between 42°C (107° F) and 44°C (111° F), and a site time of four hours or less. 
Usually, the higher the transducer temperature, the less the site time should be. Whenever you 
change the temperature setting, the monitor forces you to make a new calibration.
Using the tcGas Site Timer 
Availability and behavior of the site timer depend on your monitor’s configuration.
WARNING Prolonged continuous monitoring may increase the risk of undesirable changes in skin characteristics, 
such as irritation, reddening, blistering or burns. If the site timer is disabled, the transducer will heat 
indefinitely while on a patient. Change the site regularly, in accordance with medical procedures in 
your hospital.
Setting the tcGas Site Timer
The site timer helps reduce the risk of skin burn by ensuring that the transducer is used at one site for 
no longer than a predefined period. It reminds you when this period expires.
1 In the Setup tcGas menu, select Site Time.
2 Choose the time you want the transducer to remain on the measurement site. The optimum time 
depends on the transducer temperature and your patient’s skin sensitivity.
The site timer starts automatically when you remove the calibrated transducer from the calibration 
chamber. If you return the transducer to the chamber and then remove it again, the site time continues 
to count down the remaining time; it does not start a new time period. The time remaining before the 
site timer expires appears in the status line which is visible as long as the Setup tcGas menu is 
open. When the time expires, the monitor sounds a tone and a displays a change site INOP. The 
monitor either switches off the transducer heating or continues monitoring, depending on its 
configuration. Although you can reuse the transducer for up to two hours after the heating is switched 
off, without making a new calibration, you are recommended to recalibrate before applying it to a 
patient. After two hours without heat, you must recalibrate.
During the initial few minutes of use, the monitor eliminates false alarms by temporarily suppressing 
tcGas alarms. It displays the “STABILIZING” INOP. After you apply the transducer to the skin, the 
instrument reading slowly assumes a steady value. The reading stabilizes when the measurement site is 
warm and local hyperemization is complete. This takes 10 to 20 minutes for the tcpO2 reading and 
three to seven minutes for tcpCO2.196
Setting the tcGas Barometric Pressure 16 Monitoring tcGasRestarting the tcGas SiteTimer
To restart the site timer without recalibration (for example, after the site time has elapsed):
1 In the Setup tcGas menu, select Site Time.
2 Enter and confirm your desired time.
Disabling the tcGas Site Timer
Depending on your monitor’s configuration, you might be able to disable the site timer. Remember, 
this means that the transducer heats indefinitely while on a patient.
1 In Setup tcGas menu, select Site Timer and switch this to Disabled.
2 Select the Confirm popup key.
Setting the tcGas Barometric Pressure
Altitude and barometric pressure affect tcGas values. The monitor derives barometric pressure from its 
altitude setting. If you want to set the true barometric pressure you must do this before starting a 
calibration - changes after calibration do not influence tcGas values. The monitor remembers this 
pressure setting until you enter a new one.
1 In the Setup tcGas menu, select AmbientPress.
2 Enter the current barometric pressure reading indicated by your barometer.
3 Select the Confirm popup key.
Remembraning the tcGas Transducer
CAUTION The tcGas transducer is thin and flexible. You must treat it with care. Avoid kinking, bending or 
pulling the cable.
Remembrane the transducer if the electrolyte in your transducer has dried out or:
• if the transducer is new
• if you are using the transducer with a new patient
• if the membranes are damaged (scratched or wrinkled)
• after five days of continued use or 28 days of storage.197
16 Monitoring tcGas Remembraning the tcGas Transducer5 Remove any surplus electrolyte solution on the outside of the membranes with a soft tissue.
6 Make sure that the new membranes are secured by two O-rings on the transducer. If any air 
bubbles are visible under the membranes, repeat this procedure - air bubbles will cause incorrect 
readings.
7 After 24 hours you can calibrate the transducer. You must remembrane all new and dried out 
transducers twice before calibration.
New/Dried Out Transducers
Remembrane all new or dried out transducers twice before using. After the first remembraning, unplug 
the transducer from the module and leave it for 24 hours with the cap on. Remembrane again before 
calibrating. 
Storing tcGas Transducers 
If you need to store a sensor for more than 24 hours, protect it for up to 28 days by putting two drops 
of electrolyte solution into the cap. Screw the cap on the sensor. Remembrane if it dries out or after 28 
days.
1 Unscrew the protection cap from the transducer and 
hook the O-ring remover under both O-rings to remove 
them.
2 Remove both of the clear plastic membranes using your 
fingers.
3 Clean the transducer head, including the groove and 
rim, with absorbent paper to remove all old electrolyte 
(old electrolyte causes incorrect values) and apply 
approximately two drops of electrolyte solution to the 
transducer head.
4 Press the transducer head downwards into an unused 
membrane replacer until the replacer retracts as far as it 
can and you hear a click. Discard used replacer.198
Calibrating the tcGas Transducer 16 Monitoring tcGasCalibrating the tcGas Transducer
You can use either a Philips (15210B) or a Radiometer TCC3 calibration unit and a gas cylinder whose 
pressure indicator is above the ‘out-of-gas’ zone (black on 15210B, red on TCC3). To maintain 
accuracy, it is recommended to calibrate the transducer every four hours, even if the monitor does not 
prompt you to do so. You MUST calibrate when:
• you remembrane the transducer
• you change the transducer heat setting
• you doubt the measurement accuracy
• you start a new monitoring period or use a new site
• the monitor displays the “calibration required” INOP message.
1 Connect the calibration unit to the inlet on the side of the module’s calibration chamber using the 
recommended gas tubing. Different tubing will cause inaccurate measurements.
2 Plug the transducer cable into the module. Swing the calibration chamber cover open and insert 
the transducer into the chamber. Close the cover to secure the transducer. Set the transducer 
temperature at the monitor now.
3 On the 15210B calibration unit, turn the timer control clockwise as far as you can. On the 
Radiometer calibration unit, press the button with the green arrow once. 199
16 Monitoring tcGas Calibrating the tcGas Transducer4 Press CAL on the module until the light above the key comes on and wait (three - 20 minutes) for 
the “calibration complete” message to appear on the monitor. Alternatively, in the Setup tcGas 
menu, select Start Calibration. To save gas on 15210B, if the timer control dial is not in the 
start position when the monitor displays the calibration complete message, turn the dial counter-
clockwise to the start position. For TCC3, if the green light is still flashing when INOP “tcGas 
CalRunning” disappears, press the green arrow button again.
Calibration Failure
If calibration fails, the monitor displays “...tcGas transducer or Cal Unit malf” and the 
CAL FAILED INOP for the measurement.
Troubleshooting tcGas Calibration
Perform each of the following steps, in order, until calibration is successful.
1 Check the calibration unit, then recalibrate, remembering to turn on the gas supply on the 
calibration unit. If the pressure indicator reading is in the out of gas zone, there is insufficient gas 
in the cylinder. Connect the gas tubing firmly to the calibration unit and to the module’s 
calibration chamber.
2 If Step 1 fails, check whether you need to activate the transducer (necessary if the electrolyte has 
dried out or if you have a new transducer). Remembrane the transducer, removing the old 
membranes, and cleaning the transducer head thoroughly. 
3 Calibrate a second time.
4 If Step 2 is unsuccessful, calibrate again. This calibration may be required to stabilize the 
electrochemical system in the transducer.
5 Only if the above steps are unsuccessful (you have activated and remembraned the transducer and 
calibration has still failed twice), replace the transducer.200
Applying the tcGas Transducer 16 Monitoring tcGasApplying the tcGas Transducer
1 Peel protection film from fixation ring. Using a finger, press the sticky side of the ring on to clean, 
dry skin. Press around the outside to ensure a good seal. Apply three to five drops of contact fluid 
in the ring’s center. Remove transducer from chamber.
2 Align the arrow on the transducer with the tab on the ring and fasten by turning turn a quarter-
turn clockwise. Wait 10-20 minutes for readings to stabilize.
3 Apply the transducer as soon as possible after you see the “...calibration complete” message. If you 
wait longer than 30 minutes, the heat supply to the transducer switches off to prevent the 
electrolyte from drying out and a new calibration is necessary. 
Optimize the measurement by selecting a site with high capillary density and blood flow, thin 
epidermis and no cardiovascular disorders. Most physicians use the abdomen, chest and back.
WARNING You must either remove the transducer before defibrillating, or remembrane and calibrate the 
transducer after defibrillating.
CAUTION To avoid transducer damage, remove it from the patient during high frequency surgical procedures.201
16 Monitoring tcGas Finishing tcGas MonitoringSelecting the tcGas HeatPowerDisplay Mode
The heat power display gives an indication of the skin’s perfusion below the transducer and of the 
transducer’s contact with the skin. If the transducer loses contact, the heat power value drops 
significantly. When perfusion is poor you need less heat power to maintain the transducer temperature.
♦ In the Setup tcGas menu, select HeatPowerDisplay to toggle between Relative and 
Absolute. Choose Relative when the skin temperature is stable (the STABILIZING INOP 
disappears). This indicates subsequent changes in the relative heat power (and therefore changes in 
perfusion or transducer contact) since the last zeroing.
Zeroing the tcGas Relative Heat Power
When you start a calibration, the HeatPowerDisplay is set to Absolute. When you switch to 
Relative, it automatically zeros. Zero again if you change application site.
Finishing tcGas Monitoring
♦ Replace the transducer in the calibration chamber.
When changing the application site after a measuring period, some users leave the fixation rings in 
position to allow them to quickly move the transducer from site to site. Always unscrew the transducer 
from the fixation ring before removing the fixation ring from the skin.
TcGas Corrections
Transcutaneous pCO2 values tend to be higher than arterial values due to the metabolic processes of 
the skin and the effect of heating on the blood under the transducer. Depending on your monitor’s 
configuration, one or both of these corrections may automatically apply.
Temperature Correction for tcpCO2
The transducer temperature causes an increase in partial CO2 pressure. Your monitor may be 
configured to correct this.
♦ In the Setup tcpGas menu, look at the menu item CO2 Correction. If correction is enabled, 
it is set to On.
Metabolism Correction for tcpCO2 
CO2 production in the epidermis increases the CO2 value. Your monitor may be configured to 
automatically deduct a metabolism factor (only applies when CO2 Correction is on).
♦ In the Setup tcGas menu, look at the value shown for the menu item MetabolismFactor. 
This is deducted from the CO2 value.202

only
The SvO2 module measures the percentage of mixed venous oxygen saturation continuously and 
invasively using the Hospira, Inc. (formerly Abbott Laboratories) OptiCath family of catheters routed 
via the right side of the heart into the pulmonary artery. Can be used only with the MP60/MP70/
MP80/MP90 monitors. 
WARNING Injected dyes, such as methylene blue, or intravascular dyshemoglobin may lead to inaccurate 
measurements.
Do not monitor oxygen saturation during infusion of I.V. fat emulsion or other turbid substances 
through the distal lumen of the OptiCath catheter. These liquids might temporarily modify the blood 
scattering and absorption characteristics at the catheter tip. This interferes with the optical 
measurement of oxygen saturation. After infusion is complete, you can again monitor oxygen 
saturation accurately.
During injection of the bolus for thermodilution cardiac output measurements, the SvO2 
measurement might be disturbed.203
17 Monitoring SvO2 Preparing to Monitor SvO2Preparing to Monitor SvO2 
In addition to an SvO2 module, you need a Hospira OptiCath catheter, and 50131 Optical Module. 
Use only the Hospira accessories listed in the Accessories section.
Connect the optical module (Hospira 50131) to the SvO2 module. Allow the optical module to warm 
up before you perform a calibration. Although the warm up message disappears from the screen after 
one minute, Hospira recommends letting the optical module warm up for 15 minutes for best 
accuracy. Please refer to the instructions for the optical module.
To avoid false alarms during the pre-insertion calibration and insertion of the catheter into the patient, 
the monitor automatically suspends alarms during the pre-insertion calibration, for up to three minutes 
after you remove the catheter tip from the optical reference. After light intensity calibration, or after 
three minutes (whichever comes first), the monitor returns to the alarm state it was in prior to pre-
insertion calibration.
Carrying out a Pre-insertion Calibration 
WARNING It is strongly recommended to carry out a pre-insertion calibration prior to all insertions. If this is not 
possible, you must perform an in-vivo calibration after insertion.
Refer to the instructions for use that accompany the catheter. Do not use the catheter if the packaging 
is damaged. If you have to disconnect the monitor from the patient (for example, when transferring the 
patient from one location to another), you must disconnect at the SvO2 module. The catheter should 
remain in the optical module, otherwise you need to recalibrate.

Inserting the Catheter 17 Monitoring SvO23 Place the optical connector into the optical module (with the label “TOP” facing upwards) and 
close the lid.
4 In the Setup SvO2 menu, select Start Pre-InsCal. Ensure that the tip of the catheter is still 
in the optical reference.
5 Insert the catheter when you see the message SvO2 calibration completed - catheter 
ready for insertion. If the calibration fails, repeat the calibration before inserting the 
catheter. If it fails a second time, replace the optical module.
Inserting the Catheter
1 Remove the inner cover of the catheter tray.
2 Remove the catheter tip from the optical reference. Check the catheter's proper operation (for 
example: the balloon tip).
3 Prepare and insert the catheter in accordance with standard hospital practice.
The SvO2 catheter is thin and flexible, treat it carefully. Avoid kinking, bending or grasping the 
catheter with forceps or a hemostat. Damage to the fiber results in low intensity light and sudden 
decrease in intensity readings. Refer to the documentation provided with the fibre-optic catheter, 
paying special attention to any precautions, warnings or contraindications.
Secure the optical module directly or in close proximity to the patient, to avoid placing excessive 
tension on the catheter, which would result in movement of the catheter tip from the optimal position 
in the patient. Position the optical module to avoid contact with liquids, because fluid entering the 
catheter-optical module connection may impair light transmission.
If you place the catheter in the patient without performing the pre-insertion calibration, you must 
perform an in-vivo calibration once the catheter is in place.
Performing a Light Intensity Calibration
Perform a light intensity calibration after the catheter is in its proper position. When the catheter is 
positioned properly, the light intensity indicator must cover at least two small divisions above the 
midpoint.
♦ In the Setup SvO2 menu, select Start Light Cal.
Calibration is complete after a few seconds. If you doubt existing light intensity readings, recalibrate.

17 Monitoring SvO2 Performing In-Vivo CalibrationPerforming In-Vivo Calibration
Perform an in-vivo calibration:
• if you place the catheter in a patient without performing a pre-insertion calibration.
• if the catheter was disconnected from the optical module.
• when the catheter has been in the patient for 24 hours.
• if any significant change in light intensity occurs that the monitor cannot correct automatically.
Setting Up the In-Vivo Calibration
Check for:
• proper positioning of the catheter in the patient.
• relatively stable oxygen saturation in patient.
• that the SvO2 light intensity indicator covers at least two divisions above the midpoint.
Making the In-Vivo Calibration
1 Be prepared to draw a blood sample from the patient.
2 In the Setup SvO2 menu, select Start In-VivoCal.
3 To clear the distal lumen, draw off and discard at least 2 ml of blood before taking the sample.
4 Draw a blood sample from the distal port of the catheter and flush the line according to standard 
hospital practice.
5 Obtain laboratory analysis of the sample using direct measurements.
6 Compare the results with the stored calibration value displayed in the Setup SvO2 menu. If the 
difference is less, or equal, to 4%, you can skip the next step.
7 If there is a difference of more than 4% between the stored value and the laboratory value, select 
CalibrationValue to adjust the stored value. Selecting Recall PreviousC recalls the 
previously stored calibration value.
8 Complete the calibration by selecting Store In-VivoCal (even if you did not adjust the 
calibration value). This updates the data stored in the optical module.
Calculating Oxygen Extraction
Oxygen extraction is the difference between the measured SpO2 and SvO2 values. If you are 
monitoring SpO2 and SvO2, the monitor can calculate this value and display it as a numeric. 
♦ To switch oxygen extraction calculation on or off, in the Setup Sp-vO2 menu, select Sp-vO2 
and toggle between On and Off. 
♦ If more than one SpO2 value is available, you must choose which value is used in the calculation. 
In the Setup Sp-vO2 menu, select SpO2 Source and select the required source.
If one of the calculation sources becomes unavailable, the monitor displays the INOP 
Sp-vO2 CHK SOURCES for one minute. After this time, the calculation automatically switches off. 
If the missing source becomes available again, the calculation automatically switches on again. 206
1818Monitoring EEG
The Electroencephalograph (EEG) module monitors the patient’s cerebral function by measuring the 
electrical activity of the brain. It provides the monitor with two channels of realtime EEG waves, EEG 
trend information in the form of Compressed Spectral Arrays (CSA), and up to eight of the following 
numerics: 
Spectral Edge Frequency (SEF): The SEF is the frequency below which a defined percentage of the 
Total Power lies. The percentage is set in Configuration Mode.
Mean Dominant Frequency (MDF): The MDF is the mean value of the frequency which dominates 
the measured EEG.
Peak Power Frequency (PPF): The PPF is the frequency with the highest measured amplitude.
Total Power (TP): The TP numeric indicates the power in the measured frequency band.
Percentage of total power in each frequency band:
– Alpha waves (8 to 13 Hz)
– Beta waves (13 to 30 Hz)
– Theta waves (4 to 8 Hz)
– Delta waves (0.5 to 4 Hz).207
18 Monitoring EEG EEG Monitoring SetupEEG Monitoring Setup
1 Plug the trunk cable into the EEG module in the Flexible Module Server.
2 Prepare the patient’s skin prior to placing the electrodes. Good electrode-to-skin contact is 
important for a good EEG signal, as the skin is a poor conductor of electricity.
– Shave hair from sites, if necessary.
– Wash sites thoroughly with soap and water. We do not recommend using ether or pure alcohol, 
because this dries the skin and increases the resistance.
– Use a skin preparation paste to remove skin cells and oil before placing the electrodes. 
3 Select the desired electrode montage in the Setup EEG menu or in the EEG Impedance/
Montage window. 
4 Attach the reference electrode first. 
5 Place the electrodes on the patient’s head according to the selected montage. Use electrode gel if 
you are not using pre-gelled electrodes. Remember to select a site where the signal will not be 
interfered with by muscle artifacts. 
6 Connect the electrode connector end to the trunk cable.
7 Check the electrode-to-skin impedance in the EEG Impedance/Montage window.
8 For good signal quality, keep all lead wires together and away from other electric devices and 
metallic bodies.

18 Monitoring EEG Using the EEG Impedance/Montage WindowAbout Electrode-to-Skin Impedance
Electrode-to-skin impedance is the main quality indicator for the measured EEG signal. During 
normal EEG monitoring, electrode-to-skin impedance is measured continuously and disconnected 
electrodes are detected. The impedance value for each single, independent signal electrode is displayed 
in the EEG Impedance/Montage window. If the measured electrode-to skin impedance of one or 
more electrodes is above the limit, an INOP will be issued.
For impedance measurement at least two electrodes, plus the reference electrode, must be connected.

About Compressed Spectral Arrays (CSA) 18 Monitoring EEGAbout Compressed Spectral Arrays (CSA) 
The continuous EEG signal is sampled periodically and this value is stored in a frame. Each frame is 
processed using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to provide a frequency spectrum displayed as a 
compressed spectral array (CSA). 
The CSA window provides an overview of the patient’s EEG values over time. It may be configured to 
look slightly different on your monitor.
♦ To view the CSA window permanently embedded on a Screen, select a Screen configured to 
display the CSA window. 
♦ To view the CSA window over the current Screen, select the EEG CSA SmartKey, if configured, or 
select Setup EEG or Main Setup then Show CSA. 
The CSA contains the following information
Status line Lead label for example, Fp1-T3, Fp2-T4
CSA label CSA1 or CSA2 according to EEG channel
Montage label for example, Montage A
Filter settings for example, 1-30 Hz
Buffer label and time the buffer and interval between spectral lines on the CSA
Current SEF Threshold can only be changed in Configuration Mode

18 Monitoring EEG EEG Safety InformationEEG Safety Information 
EEG Configuration and Monitor Upgrades The A.2 monitor release (software revision A.20.xx) 
introduced a new feature that lets you rename EEG montages. It is not possible to clone EEG settings 
between montages with different names, therefore all EEG settings are reset to factory defaults during 
any upgrade/downgrade/cloning actions that mix releases/software revisions/configurations before A.2/
A.20.xx with subsequent versions. You must check that all EEG settings are correct before resuming 
monitoring with a monitor that has been upgraded or cloned.
WARNING Do not touch the patient, or table, or instruments during defibrillation. 
When connecting electrodes and/or patient cables, ensure that the EEG leads and connectors do not 
come into contact with other conductive parts or earth.
High-frequency Surgery To reduce the hazard of burns in the high-frequency surgical neutral 
electrode connection, the EEG electrodes should not be located between the surgical site and the 
electro-surgical unit return electrode.
EEG and Electrical Interference
CAUTION Interference from a non-grounded instrument near the patient and electrosurgery interference can 
cause problems with the waveform and the CSA. 
Radiated field strengths above 1 V/m and patient signals ≤ 50 µV may cause noise on the EEG waves 
at various frequencies. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid the use of electrical radiating equipment 
in close proximity to the patient monitor. The noise does not influence the measurement accuracy.
Interference from ECG can be eliminated by adjusting the low filter settings.214
1919Monitoring BIS
Bispectral Index monitoring helps to monitor the level of consciousness of a patient under general 
anesthesia or sedation in the OR and ICU. The BIS sensor is placed on the patient’s forehead to 
capture electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from which several numerics are derived, including a 
single BIS value representing the level of consciousness. See the chapter on Specifications for the BIS 
intended use statement. 
The BIS Module or BIS Interface board (for MP20/MP30) provides the monitor with an EEG wave 
and the following numerics: 
Bispectral Index (BIS). The BIS numeric reflects the patient’s level of consciousness. It ranges from 
100 (fully awake) to 0 (suppression; no electrical brain activity).
Signal Quality Index (SQI). The SQI numeric reflects signal quality and provides information about 
the reliability of the BIS, SEF, TP, SR, and Bursts numerics during the last minute. 
It ranges from 0 to 100%:
SQI < 15%: the numerics cannot be derived
SQI 15% to 50%: the numerics cannot be reliably derived
SQI 50% to 100%: the numerics are reliable.
Electromyographic Activity (EMG). The EMG numeric reflects the electrical power of muscle 
activity and high frequency artifacts.
EMG < 55 dB: this is an acceptable EMG 
EMG ≤ 30 dB: this is an optimal EMG 
(note that the minimum possible EMG is approximately 25 dB).
Suppression Ratio (SR). The SR is the percentage of time over the last 63-second period during 
which the EEG is considered to be in a suppressed state.
Spectral Edge Frequency (SEF). The SEF is the frequency below which 95% of the Total Power is 
measured.
Total Power (TP). The TP numeric indicates the power in the frequency band 0.5 to 30 Hz. The 
useful range is 30 - 100 dB. 
Bursts (BISx module used with the Extend Sensor only) The Bursts numeric helps you quantify 
suppression by measuring the number of EEG bursts per minute, where an EEG burst is defined as a 
period of activity followed and preceded by inactivity (at least 0.5 second). 215
19 Monitoring BIS BIS Monitoring SetupBIS Monitoring Setup
There are two BIS solutions available for use with the M1034A BIS module: using the DSC and BIS 
engine or using the BISx.
Monitoring BIS Using the DSC and BIS Engine
1 If you are monitoring BIS with the DSC and BIS engine,
a. Connect the BIS engine to the BIS module using the BIS Engine Cable.
b. Connect the digital signal converter (DSC) to the digital signal converter port on the front of 
the BIS Engine. Use the attachment clip to secure the digital signal converter near, but not 
above the patient’s head.
c. Attach the patient interface cable (PIC) to the digital signal converter (DSC).
2 Attach the BIS sensor to the patient following the instructions supplied with the sensor. 
Make sure that the patient’s skin is dry. Be aware that a wet sensor or a salt bridge may cause 
erroneous BIS and impedance values. 
A variety of sensors are available for use in the OR and ICU environments: see the chapter on 
accessories for information. 
3 Connect the BIS sensor to the patient interface cable. 
As soon as a valid sensor is detected, the impedances of all electrodes are measured automatically 
and the results are shown in the BIS window.

a. Connect the BISx device to the BIS module or BIS Interface board connector (MP20/MP30)
b. Use the clip on the rear of the BISx device to affix it in a position convenient for your patient, 
not above the patient’s head. 
2 Attach the BIS sensor/BIS electrodes to the patient following the instructions supplied with the 
sensor. 
Make sure that the patient’s skin is dry. Be aware that a wet sensor or a salt bridge may cause 
erroneous BIS and impedance values. 
A variety of sensors are available for use in the OR and ICU environments: see the chapter on 
accessories for information. 
CAUTION Ensure that the BISx does not come into prolonged contact with your patient’s skin, as it may generate 
heat and cause discomfort.
The BISx may remain connected to a patient during defibrillation as long as the sensor is not located 
between the defibrillator pads.
3 With sensors for single-patient use:
a. Attach the patient interface cable (PIC) to the BISx device.
b. Connect the BIS sensor to the PIC. 
With Semi Re-usable Sensors:
a. Attach the sensor cable to the BISx device.
b. Snap the sensor cable onto the electrodes.
As soon as a valid sensor is detected, the impedances of all electrodes are measured automatically 
and the results are shown in the BIS window. The number of uses remaining for the semi re-usable 
sensor is shown in the status line when the BIS window is open.

19 Monitoring BIS BIS Continuous Impedance CheckManufacturer’s Information
BISx, the BIS Engine, the DSC, the Patient Interface Cable and the BIS Sensors are manufactured by 
Aspect Medical Systems.
BIS Continuous Impedance Check
This checks: 
• the combined impedance of the signal electrodes plus the reference electrode. 
This is done continuously and does not affect the EEG wave. As long as the impedances are within 
the valid range, there is no notification of this check or its results. 
• the impedance of the ground electrode. 
This is done every ten minutes and takes approximately 4 seconds. It causes an artifact in the EEG 
wave, and the message Ground Check is shown on the monitor screen during the check. If the 
ground electrode does not pass this check, another check is started. This continues until the ground 
electrode passes the check.
If the Continuous Impedance Check interferes with other measurements, it can be switched off. To do 
this:
1 In the Setup BIS menu, select Cont.Imp.Check.
2 Select On/Off to toggle between the settings.
CAUTION Switching the continuous impedance check off will disable automatic notification to the user of 
impedance value changes, which may lead to incorrect BIS values. Therefore, this should only be done 
if the check interferes with or disturbs other measurements.
When a Semi-reusable Sensor is in use the continuous impedance check cannot be switched off. If it is 
switched off when the sensor is connected, it will automatically be switched on again.
BIS Cyclic Impedance Check 
This measures the exact impedance of each individual electrode. It causes a disturbed EEG wave, and 
the INOP BIS IMPEDANCE CHCK is shown on the monitor screen during the check. 
Starting a Cyclic Impedance Check
The Cyclic Impedance Check is automatically started when a sensor is connected. To manually start a 
Cyclic Impedance Check: 
♦ select Cyclic Check in the BIS Setup menu to toggle between On and Off, or 
♦ select Start Cyclic Check in the BIS window.
Stopping a Cyclic Impedance Check
The Cyclic Impedance Check stops automatically if the impedances of all electrodes are within the 
valid range. To manually stop a Cyclic Impedance Check:
♦ select Cyclic Check in the BIS Setup menu to toggle between On and Off, or 218
BIS Window 19 Monitoring BIS♦ select Stop Cyclic Check in the BIS Impedance Check Window.
If you stop a Cyclic Impedance Check before the ground electrode has passed, a ground electrode 
impedance check will be started automatically. This cannot be switched off.
BIS Window
♦ To open the BIS window, in the Setup BIS menu, select Show Sensor.
The window may look slightly different on your monitor. The graphic in the BIS Window 
automatically adapts to show the type of sensor you are using, showing three or four electrodes as 
required. Each symbol in the graphic represents an electrode and illustrates the most recently-measured 
impedance status of the electrodes. Although BIS may still be measured when the electrode status is red 
or yellow, for best performance, all electrodes should be green. 
In addition, if the measured electrode-to skin impedance of any electrode or electrode combination is 
above the limit, or if disconnected electrodes are detected, an INOP will be issued, either BIS HIGH 
IMPEDANCE or BIS LEAD OFF.

19 Monitoring BIS Changing the BIS Smoothing RateChanging the BIS Smoothing Rate
The smoothing rate defines how the monitor averages the BIS value. 
♦ To change the smoothing rate, in the Setup BIS menu, select BIS Smoothing Rate then 
choose either:
– 15 seconds: this provides increased responsiveness to changes in the patient’s state.
– 30 seconds: this provides a smoother BIS trend with decreased variability and sensitivity to 
artifacts.
Switching BIS and Individual Numerics On and Off
To switch the BIS measurement on or off: 
♦ In the Setup BIS menu, select BIS to toggle between On and Off. 
To switch individual numerics provided by the BIS Module on or off: 
♦ In the Setup BIS menu, select SQI, TP, SEF, SR, EMG, or BURSTS to toggle between On and 
Off. 
Changing the Scale of the EEG Wave
Changing the scale only changes the visual appearance of the wave. It does not affect the signal 
analyzed by the monitor or printed in reports or recordings. 
The scale information shown depends on whether gridlines are switched on or off for display. This 
setting can only be changed in Configuration Mode.
1 In the Setup BIS menu, select Change Scale to call up a list of wave scales.
2 Select the required scale from this list. 
• When gridlines are switched off, you can choose from the available scale values: 50 µV, 100 µV, 
200 µV, and 500 µV. Scaling information is displayed as a vertical bar on the EEG wave together 
with its height equivalent in µV.
• When gridlines are switched on, scales are defined as a range, either ± 25 µV, ± 50 µV, ± 100 µV, 
or ± 250 µV. Scaling information is shown in the form of gridlines. 
Switching BIS Filters On or Off
The low and high pass filters screen out undesirable interference from the raw EEG wave display. The 
notch filter removes line frequency interference. Filter settings affect the EEG wave and the SEF and 
TP values, but they do not affect the BIS, EMG, SR, and SQI values. 
The filter settings are set in Configuration Mode. You can switch all the filters on or off together in 
Monitoring Mode. 
1 In the Setup BIS menu, select Filters.
2 Select On/Off to toggle between all filters On or Off.220
BIS Safety Information 19 Monitoring BISBIS Safety Information 
For information on the use of BIS in specific monitoring situations and on pharmacological responses 
to the anesthetic agents Nitrous Oxide (when used as the sole anesthetic agent), Ketamine, and 
Etomidate, please contact Aspect Medical Systems to request a copy of their publication “A Clinician’s 
Guide to the Bispectral Index®”.
Considerations for Use Due to limited clinical experience in the following applications, BIS values 
should be interpreted cautiously in patients with known neurological disorders, those taking 
psychoactive medications, and in children below the age of 1.
WARNING Conductive Parts The conductive parts of sensors and connectors should not contact other 
conductive parts, including earth.
High-frequency Surgery To reduce the hazard of burns in the high-frequency surgical neutral 
electrode connection, the BIS sensor should not be located between the surgical site and the electro-
surgical unit return electrode.
Defibrillation The BIS sensor must not be located between defibrillator pads when a defibrillator is 
used on a patient connected to the patient monitor.
Securing Cables To minimize the risk of patient strangulation, the patient interface cable (PIC) must 
be carefully placed and secured.
CAUTION Revisions The system will only function if all component revisions are compatible. Otherwise, an 
incompatibility INOP is displayed.
If the DSC has an older software revision than the BIS Engine, the DSC will automatically be 
upgraded by the BIS Engine. Do not disconnect the DSC from the BIS Engine, or disconnect the BIS 
module from the monitor, or switch the monitor power off within the first ten seconds after 
connection, as this will disrupt a possible software upgrade and cause damage to the DSC.
The BIS Interface board for the MP20/MP30 can only be used with BISx, not with the BIS engine. If 
the BIS engine is connected to the MP20/MP30 a BIS ENGINE INCOMPT INOP will be issued.
Impedance Checks Impedance checks may influence data acquisition of other 
electroencephalographic devices.221

2020Trends
Trends are patient data collected over time and displayed in graphic or tabular form to give you a 
picture of how your patient’s condition is developing. Trend information is stored in the trends 
database for continuously-monitored measurements, such as ECG, as well as for aperiodically-
measured parameters, such as Cardiac Output.
Viewing Trends
Trend information can be viewed embedded as a screen element on specially-designed Screens, or you 
can open a trend window over the current Screen. 
♦ To view trends embedded as a screen element, select the Screen name in the monitor info line to

window. 
♦ To open the tabular trends window over the current Screen, select the Vitals 
Trend SmartKey. 
♦ To open the graphic trends window over the current Screen, select the Graph 
Trends SmartKey.
The trend windows open displaying the most recent data and are updated as new data 
is stored. A timescale along the bottom of the screen shows you where you are in the 
trends database. The preview column on the right-hand side shows the latest available 
measurement value. The preview column is updated every five minutes or whenever an 
NBP or other aperiodic measurement is completed. 
A question mark (?) beside a value means that the data may not be reliable, due perhaps to an INOP 
condition in the measurement. 
Your monitor screen may look slightly different to the examples shown here.

Trends Databases 20 TrendsTrends Databases
Depending on the purchased options and the monitor’s configuration, the trends databases store 
information for up to 32 measurements for up to 72 hours. 
The values in the trends database are stored as measured by the monitor, they are not averaged values. 
The trend resolution defines how often a value is stored. In general, if more than one value is available 
for storage in the trends database, the most recent value is used. Some values in the trends are marked 
with arrows. This indicates that for this time period, more values were available and the most recent 
one is shown.
Example database configuration In this example, we see that the monitor stores the most recent data 
at the highest resolution, older data are stored at a lower resolution. 
“4 hours @ 12 second resolution” means that the monitor stores trend data every 12 seconds, for the 
most recent four hours. 
Aperiodic Trends Database
Aperiodic trends do not count toward the maximum number of trends allowed by the trend 
configuration. Trend data for aperiodic measurements is stored in a separate database and timestamped 
with the measurement time. 
Trending Multiple-Value Measurements
Some measurements generate multiple values, for example invasive pressure measurements can provide 
systolic, diastolic, and mean values. These values are trended as separate measurements.
Screen Trends
Trends configured to display permanently on special monitor Screens are called screen trends. The 
selection and number of measurement waves in the Screen Trend segment depends on your monitor 
configuration. Screen trends are color-coded to match the measurement wave and numerics, and they 
can be viewed in graphical, tabular, or horizon format.
If you do not see screen trends on the monitor Screen, select a different Screen, one that is configured 
to show screen trends. Screen trends are only available on specially designed Screens.

20 Trends Screen TrendsHorizon View
The horizon view presents trend information 
superimposed over a defined baseline. This 
helps you visualize changes in your patient’s 
condition since the baseline was set. 
The horizon view is made up of: 
• a horizon, drawn in white, as a reference 
point or baseline to help you visualize 
changes in your patient’s condition. The 
horizon can be set to represent your patient’s current condition, or a target condition. 
• a graphical trend, displaying patient data for the set TrendTime (1).
• a trend indicator arrow, indicating how the patient trend has developed in the last ten minutes (2).
• a deviation bar, showing how the currently measured value deviates from the stored baseline (3). The 
height of the deviation bar is an indication of the extent of the change in your patient’s condition 
relative to the (horizon) baseline. 
Your monitor may not be configured to show all three elements of the screen trend horizon view.
Setting the Horizon
The horizon is the reference value to which deviations in the measurements are compared. 
1 To set the baseline, select the horizon trend 
2 Select
– Auto All to reset the horizon for all horizon screen trends to the currently-measured values
– Auto Horizon to set the horizon for the selected horizon trend to the currently-measured value
– Set Horizon to set the horizon to a specific value from a pop-up list.
Setting the Horizon Trend Scale
The horizon trend scale is defined with respect to the horizon. If your horizon is set to 100 and you 
select 20 as the horizon scale delta, the upper limit of the horizon scale will be 120 and lower limit 80.
To set the horizon trend scale delta,
1 Select the horizon trend.
2 Select Set Scale Delta and select a value to define the distance between the horizon and the 
the upper and lower scale limits. 
Be aware that changing the horizon trend scale can change the angle of the trend indicator, without the 
patient’s condition having changed.
If a measurement exceeds the outer limits of the scale, the wave will be clipped and you must either 
reset the horizon or the horizon trend scale to display the values outside the scale limits.

2121Calculations
Calculations are patient data that is not directly measured but calculated by the monitor when you 
provide it with the appropriate information. 
Your monitor can perform the following hemodynamic, oxygenation, and ventilation calculations. 
The hemodynamic calculations available depend on the Cardiac Output measurement method being 
used and the regulatory standards that apply for your hospital: see the C.O. chapter for availability 
details.

21 Calculations Entering Values for CalculationsEntering Values for Calculations
The monitor automatically enters any available values for calculations. For aperiodically-measured 
values such as C.O., the monitor will re-use the most recent value in the calculation database until a 
new value becomes available.
♦ To enter calculations values manually or edit automatically-entered values, select the value field to 
open the on-screen keyboard and use this to enter the correct value. Values edited manually are 
marked with an asterisk symbol (*). 
If you enter a value that has more decimal places than allowed for a particular input, the value you 
enter will be rounded off after you select Enter. If you enter a value which cannot be stored, the 
message Warning: Value out of range will appear. Enter a new value.
In hemodynamic calculations, if the systolic and diastolic pressures are manually entered, the mean 
pressure is calculated and marked with an asterisk. The formula used to estimate the mean pressure is 
[systolic + (diastolic x 2)] / 3. 
Automatic Value Substitution
If the monitor cannot find a value required for calculation, it automatically tries to find an equivalent 
source for this value. For example, if C.O. is required but unavailable, the monitor automatically looks 
for CCO as a alternative source of C.O. values, or a alternative Pressure label may be used instead of 
ABP. The label of the value in the Calculations window does not change. Substituted values are 
marked with an asterisk (*). 
Automatic Unit Conversion
The monitor needs consistent units for performing calculations. It automatically converts units where 
necessary before it performs the calculation, for example, pressures sourced in kPa, cmH2O, or mbar 
are automatically converted to mmHg, or to cmH2O for ventilation calculations.
Manual Unit Conversion
If you need to convert units for other purposes you can use the Unit Conversion window:
1 Select Main Setup -> Calculations 
2 Select Unit Conversion.
3 Select the field under the unit you know and use the on-
screen keypad to enter the known value. The converted 
value automatically appears in the adjacent field.
BSA Formula
Your monitor provides both the Boyd and Dubois formulas for the calculation of body surface area 
(BSA). For calculations, the monitor uses the setting defined in the Patient Demographics menu. All 
calculation results that use BSA are indexed to the selected formula.

2222High Resolution Trend
Waves
High resolution (hi-res) trend waves provide information for fast-changing parameters at a glance. 
They can help you to recognize trend patterns and to find interrelationships between measurements, by 
comparing changes in your patient’s condition across different hi-res trend waves. This can aid in the 
early detection of cardiorespiratory and hemodynamic problems.
The amount of data you can show on a screen depends on the display size and resolution: for example, 
on an eight inch (20 cm) wave trace on your monitor screen, you can view approximately six minutes 
of hi-res trend wave trace. The hi-res waves are drawn at a speed of 3 cm/minute. 
The availability of hi-res trend waves depends on your monitor configuration and on the options 
purchased for your monitor. 
Changing the Hi-Res Trend Waves Displayed
♦ To change the selection of hi-res trend waves on the Screen, select the hi-res trend wave and select 
the required hi-res trend wave from the list of available measurements.
If there are no hi-res trend waves on the Screen, you must change to a Screen with hi-res trend waves.
Hi-Res Trend Wave Scales 
High-resolution trend waves are either compressed realtime waves or fast numeric trends.
• Hi-res trend waves from compressed realtime waves include: Resp, CO2, ABP, PAP, CVP, ICP, AWP, 
anesthetic agents.
• Hi-res trend waves from fast numeric trends include: btbHR, SpO2, tcpO2, tcpCO2, Pulse, Perf, 
CPP, BIS, CCO, inO2, Delta SpO2. 
Hi-res trend waves from waves use the wave scale as their display scale. Changing the wave scale 
changes the hi-res trend wave scale. 
Hi-res trend waves from numerics use a pre-defined display scale dependent on the patient category. 
Hi-Res Trend Waves and OxyCRG
OxyCRG is a combination of three hi-res trend waves, btbHR, SpO2, and Resp, mainly used in 
neonatal monitoring. 239
22 High Resolution Trend Waves Printing Hi-Res Trend Wave ReportsPrinting Hi-Res Trend Wave Reports
To print hi-res trend waves on reports, you can choose to print either 
• all VisibleWaves - prints all waves and hi-res trend waves currently displayed
• All Waves - prints realtime waves and hi-res trend waves for all currently-monitored 
measurements
• HiRes Waves - prints hi-res trend waves for the currently-monitored measurements
• OxyCRG Waves - prints hi-res trend waves for btbHR, SpO2, and Resp.
For each hi-res trend wave, six minutes of measurement data will be printed. 
See the section on Reports for more information on setting up reports.
Hi-Res Trend Wave Recordings
The selection of waves in hi-res trend wave recordings and the printing speed are defined by the pre-
configured HiResTrd recording template. See the section on Recordings for more information. 
To start a hi-res trend waves recording, 
1 select the Realtime Record SmartKey, if configured, or select Main Setup -> 
Recordings 
2 select the Start HiResTrd pop-up key.240
2323Event Surveillance
Events are electronic records of episodes in your patient’s condition. You can trigger them manually, or 
set them to trigger automatically during pre-defined clinical situations. Depending on the level of event 
surveillance available on your monitor, the information stored for each event episode can include: 
• waveforms for up to four measurements of your choice (depending on episode type, see table on 
page 243 for more details)
• numeric vital signs for all the measurements monitored
• any alarm conditions active when the event episode was triggered
• any annotations connected with the event.
You can navigate through the event database to view events retrospectively, and you can document 
events on a recording or report marked with the patient name, bed label, and the data and time. 
Levels of Event Surveillance
The appearance of the Events windows and menus and the settings you can select for events depends 
on the event surveillance option purchased for your monitor: basic event surveillance, advanced event 
surveillance, or neonatal event review. This table lists the differences between the options. 
To determine which level of event surveillance your monitor has, select Main Setup -> 
Event Surveill. -> Setup Events and select the trigger group to see the available event groups. 
• if the only event group listed is NER, your monitor has the Neonatal Event Review option
• if there is one event group and it is not NER, your monitor has the Basic Event Surveillance option
• if you see six event groups, your monitor has the Advanced Event Surveillance option.

23 Event Surveillance Event GroupsEvent Groups
The event group
• monitors the patient’s signals to detect event triggers
• defines which waveforms are recorded in the event data.
In basic event surveillance only one event group can be active at a time, with Advanced Event 
Surveillance all six groups can be active simultaneously. Active event groups monitor for event triggers. 
Event groups are defined in Configuration Mode. In monitoring mode the groups can be adapted to 
current conditions, for example episode types and threshold levels can be changed .
Event Episodes
When an event occurs, information for a 
predefined duration is stored. This is the 
event episode. It includes information 
from a defined period before the trigger, 
called the event pre-time. The episode 
time after the event is called the event 
post-time. If a further event occurs during 
the event post-time it changes a single 
event to a combined event (combi-event). 
Manually-triggered event episodes 
document patient information from the 
time leading up to the event trigger; they 
do not have a post-time.

resolution, the shorter the period that the monitor can store in its memory. High-resolution data is 
suited for neonatal applications, where the clinical situation may change very quickly. In adult 
monitoring, where the patient’s status typically changes more gradually, a longer trend may be more 
informative.

23 Event Surveillance Event TriggersEvent Triggers
You can trigger event capture manually, for example, if you want to record a patient’s condition before 
a procedure. You can also set events to trigger automatically, when the patient’s values cross a 
predefined threshold value, or when a particular measurement or procedure is carried out, for example, 
when an NBP measurement or a Cardiac Output or Wedge procedure is carried out. 
If more than one trigger is available for the measurements in the active event group, the trigger 
condition may be AtLeast1Par, AtLeast2Par, AtLeast3Par,or All4Par. If the trigger is 
AtLeast1Par (this is short for ‘at least one measurement parameter’), the monitor starts an event 
capture if a trigger occurs in any of this event group’s measurements. If the trigger is AtLeast3Par, 
the monitor captures events when three or more trigger thresholds from this event group’s 
measurements are violated. With Enhanced Condition you can not only select a minimum 
number of triggers to trigger an event but define which specific measurement triggers these must be. 
For example, AtLeast2Par will cause an event to be captured if a trigger occurs in any two of this 
event group’s measurements - with Enhanced Condition you can select that only when triggers are 
in HR and SpO2 an event will be captured.
The trigger condition for event groups is set in the monitor’s Configuration Mode.

Event Triggers 23 Event SurveillanceIf you use alarm limits as event triggers, the event capture is triggered automatically when your 
patient’s values violate set alarm limits, or when a specified alarm condition, such as apnea, occurs. No 
events of this kind are triggered if alarms are switched off. Changing alarm limits changes the event 
trigger definitions.
The asterisk symbols beside the trigger tell you about the alarm triggers: 
*** indicates a high priority (red) alarm
** indicates a lower priority (yellow) alarm. This category includes short yellow arrhythmia alarms, 
which may be configured to be shown as one star alarms (*) on your monitor.
Triggers without asterisk symbols are user-defined triggers.
If you set user-defined threshold triggers, you can define event triggers that are independent of alarm 
limits. You must set a threshold value and a threshold time for the trigger. If you set the trigger 
threshold time to 12 seconds, the monitor triggers an event if the threshold is violated for more than 12 
seconds.
If you set On Measurement triggers, you can set aperiodic measurements (such as NBP) or 
procedures (such as Cardiac Output) to trigger an event whenever they start.
If you set user-defined deviation triggers, you can define event triggers that are independent of 
specific limits and based instead on deviations from the current values. You must set a deviation and a 
period of time in which the deviation occurs. There are three types of deviation available: ANY 
deviation, UP deviation where only changes in a positive direction are detected and DOWN 
deviation where only changes in a negative direction are detected. The deviation can be defined 
either in relative terms as a percentage, for example 10%, or as an absolute value, such as 10 bpm. 
Event Retriggering
If a condition that triggered an event persists and the values remain beyond the trigger threshold, a new 
event will not be triggered.
For a new event to be triggered by the same condition, the measured values for at least one of the 
triggers must cross back into the normal range and then recross the trigger threshold.
Event Notification 
(Advanced Event Surveillance Only). You can be notified when an event is detected. For each event 
group you can define a type of notification depending on the severity of the event conditions. The 
notification can be a status message with a prompt tone or a standard *, **, or *** alarm notification. 
These event alarms are handled exactly like measurement alarms; they can be silenced and are also 
suspended when all alarms are suspended. You should only use alarm notification for events which are 
comparable in severity to standard measurement alarms to avoid potential confusion due to too many 
alarms. Notification in the form of an alarm is not available when the trigger condition is At Least 
One Param. Selecting None switches event notification off.
Setting the type of notification, or switching notification off, is done in Configuration Mode.

The Events Database 23 Event SurveillanceFor manually-triggered events. patient information for the time leading up to the trigger moment is 
stored using the settings of the assigned event group. 
The Events Database 
The maximum number of events that can be stored in the event database depends on the database 
configuration and the level of event surveillance used. The event database is set up in the monitor’s 
Configuration Mode. Events are stored in the monitor’s event database for the configured lifetime, 
either 8 hours or 24 hours. Deleted events cannot be retrieved. Events are automatically deleted when: 
• their configured lifetime is over
• the storage capacity of the database is exceeded (storing a further event deletes the oldest event in the 
memory)
• a patient is discharged. 
As the event database is cleared when you discharge a patient, you should ensure that you have 
documented any events you require for the patient records before you confirm the discharge.
Viewing Events
• To see a summary of all the events in every group in the event database, use the Event Summary 
window. 
• To review all the events in a particular event group, use the Event Review window. 
• To review individual event episodes in detail, use the Event Episode window. 
Event Counter 
Vertical bars mark 
events in the Event 
Summary window. 
The timeline shows 
the position of the stored events in the event database. Selecting this view activates a cursor that lets 
you navigate across the timeline and select individual events for review in the Episode Review 
window. It also calls up the events pop-up keys.
The event counter counts the total number of events in the database. If more than one event group was 
set to trigger events within the event history, the event counter also counts the event group totals. 
To start viewing events, either:
♦ in the Main Setup menu, select Event Surveillance and then select the event view 
you require from the list, or 
♦ select the Event Surveillance SmartKey and then select the event view 
you require from the list. 
Event Counter Event Counter (Graphic)247
23 Event Surveillance Viewing EventsCounting Combi-Events
If one or more events occur during the same Episode Time, the monitor combines them and displays 
them as distinct events in one event episode, called a combi-event. The first event is the trigger event, 
and the others are follow-up events. For example, if an apnea event is followed 40 seconds later by a 
brady event, the brady event is not counted as a single event but as part of the apnea event. 
Counting Neonatal Event Review (NER) Events
For neonatal events (NER, formerly “OxyCRG”), apnea events (A), bradycardia events (B), and 
combinations of these events are counted and classified by the event counter in the Event Summary. If 
they are associated with a Desaturation (D), this is also marked. Manual events (M) are counted 
separately. In the example below, A(D):2(1) indicates that two apnea events occurred and one of 
them was associated with a desaturation.
16 Stored Events: A(D):2(1) B(D):7(1) AB (D): 1(1) D:6 M:0248
Viewing Events 23 Event SurveillanceEvent Summary Window 
(Advanced Event Surveillance only). The Event Summary window shows the number of stored events 
in each event group and the total number of events in the database. Vertical bars mark events on a 
timeline showing the position of the stored events in the event database. The symbol next to the group 
name indicates the activation and notification status:
Selecting the Event Summary window calls up the events pop-up keys. 
Parts of the Event Summary window can also be embedded in Screens so that they are always visible, 
for example the Total row showing the total number of events with the bars on the timeline or the 
column showing all the groups with the activation and notification status.
Event Review Window
♦ To enter the Event Review window, select the graphic event summary, if available, or select the 
events pop-up key Show Review. 
♦ When you open the Event Review window, it automatically shows the event group with the 
most recent event. To view other event groups, select the pop-up key Review Group and select 
the group from the list.

23 Event Surveillance Viewing EventsEvent bars: Each event bar represents one event. The height indicates the event severity. Bars that 
extend over more than one channel represent combi-events. Manually-captured events are marked with 
a bar above the timeline instead of in the measurement channels. 
Event values: Event information for the currently-selected event is shown on the left of the review 
window. The trigger measurement is highlighted. 
– If an alarm triggers the event, the monitor shows the alarm conditions that triggered the event. 
– If the event trigger was user-defined, instead of an alarm condition the monitor shows for 
example SpO2 94<96, where the second number is the current event trigger threshold and the 
first number is the maximum deviation from the set limit. 
Trigger threshold: The horizontal lines show the trigger thresholds. Gaps in the line indicate that the 
trigger was inactive for a while, possibly because alarms were switched off or because there was an 
INOP condition in the group measurements.
Timeline: The timeline at the bottom indicates the period currently stored in the event database.
Event Episode Window 
♦ To enter the Event Episode window, select the pop-up key Show Episode.
Depending on the event group settings, the Event Episode window shows either 20 minutes of 
average trend event information, four minutes of high-resolution event information, or 15 seconds of 
realtime wave information.

24 Recording All ECG Waves RecordingsAll ECG Waves Recordings
An All ECG Waves recording shows a 4 second recording of each lead with a calibration bar 
preceding each ECG lead. All available leads are recorded sequentially in the standardized lead order. 
The recording is realtime, that is, the information recorded is not simultaneous. 
Creating and Changing Recordings Templates
To save you defining recording settings each time you start a recording, you can create templates for 
commonly-used types of recordings in the Setup Recording menu. You can create templates for 
one delayed recording, one alarm recording, three realtime recordings, and one high resolution 
recording. All ECG Waves recordings do not need to be configured, they always use the same 
format.
Changing recordings templates changes the settings that will be used each time a recording of this 
name is triggered.

Changing ECG Wave Gain 24 Recording3 Select the name of the template you want to create or change. Each recording name is linked to a 
recording type, delayed, alarm, realtime, and high res trends. Recording names can be changed in 
the monitor’s Configuration Mode. 
4 Design the template by selecting each menu item and entering the information for the template. 
• Recorder: choose which recorder the recording will print to (Local, Central 2-Ch. or Central 4-
Ch.). 
• Channels 1 - 4: choose which waveform to record in each channel. If the wave assigned to a 
recording channel in a particular template is not available when a recording is triggered, the channel 
is left blank on the recording strip. The pop-up list of available (currently monitored) waves differs 
according to the recording type: 
– Realtime, delayed and alarm recordings: the list shows all the currently available waves. 
– High-resolution recordings: the list shows all the available high-resolution waves
In addition to the currently available waves, you can choose from several other settings which make 
an automatic allocation when the recording starts:
– Alarm Par will always record the measurement in alarm in the chosen recorder channel
– Primary Lead will always record the current primary lead in the chosen recorder channel
– Secondary Lead will always record the current secondary lead in the chosen recorder 
channel
– Agent will always record the currently selected anesthetic agent.
For high-resolution recordings only the Agent setting is available.
• Overlap: define whether the recorded waveforms will be printed overlapping or beside each other.
• Speed: choose the recording print speed.
• Delay Time: Delayed recordings start documenting on the recorder strip from a pre-set time 
before the recording is started. This interval is called the “Delay Time” and can be set to 10 or 15 
seconds. This setting can only be changed in Configuration Mode.
• Runtime: see how long this type of recording is configured to run. This setting can only be changed 
in Configuration Mode. Continuous recordings run indefinitely.
• Central Config - if available, select this setting to use the recordings settings set for the 
centrally-connected recorder.
Changing ECG Wave Gain
The ECG Gain setting in the General menu defines how every recorded ECG wave, irrespective of 
template or recording type, will appear on the recorder strip. This does not affect the displayed ECG 
wave, or printed ECG reports. To change the ECG gain setting for recordings, 
1 In the Setup Recording menu select General 
2 Select ECG Gain.
3 Select the required setting:
– Auto: the wave recording will use the same scale as the ECG wave on the monitor screen
– 5 mm/mV, 10 mm/mv, 20 mm/mV: the wave recording will use a scale of 5, 10, or 20 
millimeters per millivolt.261
24 Recording Recording PrioritiesRecording Priorities
Manually-started recordings have priority over automatically-started recordings. If an 
automatically-triggered alarm recording is running, and a realtime or delayed recording is manually 
started, the alarm recording is stopped and the manually-requested recording is started.
More recent manually-started recordings have priority over older manually-started recordings. If a 
manually-started recording is running, and another manually-started recording is triggered, then the 
older recording is stopped and the more recent manually-started recording is started. 
Alarm recordings are prioritized according to alarm priority. If an alarm recording triggered by a 
yellow alarm is running and a new alarm recording is triggered by a red alarm, the yellow alarm 
recording is stopped and the red alarm recording is started.
Sample Recording Strip
The information printed on the recording strip includes the patient name and MRN, bed number, 
date and time of recording, recording speed, and recording code. Active alarm and INOP messages as 
well as numerics for all currently monitored measurements are also printed.
Recording strip annotations are printed at the beginning of the recording strip and updated at regular 
intervals, every 15 minutes for recordings made at speeds lower than 6.25 mm/s, and every 60 seconds 
for recordings made at speeds greater or equal to 6.25 mm/s. 
This sample recording strip shows a typical initial annotation: 
Recording Strip Code
The recording strip code printed in the first line of the initial annotation has up to seven characters, 
specifying recording type, operating mode, application area, patient category, and delay time, if 
applicable.

centrally-connected printers.
♦ To enter the Setup Printers menu, in the Reports menu, select Setup Printers.270
Printing a Test Report 25 Printing Patient ReportsPrinting a Test Report
A test report can be printed in Configuration mode, refer to the Service Guide for details.
Switching Printers On Or Off for Reports
You can enable or disable printer status to switch individual printers on or off for report printouts. 
1 In the Setup Printers menu, select Printer and then select the name of the device you want 
to switch on or off for Reports printing from the pop-up list.
2 Select Printer Status to toggle between the settings Enable and Disable. If you set this to 
Disable, no reports will be printed to the named printer. 
If the monitor detects that no printer of a particular type is available, the Enable/Disable 
setting will automatically be set to Disable and “grayed out”.
Dashed Lines on Reports
If a section of a wave on a report is drawn with dashed lines, this tells 
you that a setting that affects the appearance of the wave on the 
screen was changed while the report was printing. 
For example, if you change the wave scale while a report is printing, 
the wave scale and wave size are changed immediately on the 
monitor screen and on the report. To indicate that the scale 
information printed at the beginning of the report no longer matches the currently used scale, the wave 
will be printed using dashed lines, starting from the moment the change took place. 
Some examples of settings that cause dashed lines in reports if changed during printing are: Filter 
mode, ECG lead placement, wave scale, measurement unit, paced/non-paced setting, and 
measurement mode. Note that as ECG waves are drawn with a fixed gain on reports (either 10 mm/
mV or 20 mm/mV), changing the ECG wave scale will not cause dashed-line reports. 
To avoid dashed lines on reports, wait 15 seconds after changing a setting before you trigger a report.
Unavailable Printer: Re-routing Reports
If you send a report to be printed on a printer that is not available, for example, because it has run out 
of paper, this print job is suspended and stored in the monitor’s memory.
If the target device of this print job was set to Unspecified, the monitor will periodically try to 
resend the print job to the first printer listed in the Setup Printers menu under Printer that 
is set to Enabled and that has paper of the correct size. 
To allow the report to print, you must either solve the problem with the target printer, or re-route the 
print job to another printer with paper of the correct size. To re-rout a print job,
♦ Enable the new target printer by selecting it in the Setup Printers menu and toggling to 
Enabled. As the monitor tries to send the report to the printers in the order they are listed, you 
must make sure that all the printers above the new target printer are disabled.
If the target device of the print job was set to a specific printer, re-routing is not possible. 271

2626Using the Drug Calculator
Drug mixtures for intravenous (IV) drug infusions combine information on drug dose, rate, amount, 
volume, concentration, and standardized rate. The Drug Calculator helps you to manage infusions by 
calculating one of these values at a time. 
*Be aware that your hospital may use either ‘µg’ or ‘mcg’ as an abbreviation for microgram. These 
abbreviations are equivalent.
WARNING Before you administer any drug, always check that the correct calculation units and patient category are 
selected. Consult your pharmacy if you have questions.
Decisions on the choice and dosage of drugs administered to patients must always be made by the 
physician in charge. The Drug Calculator performs calculations based on the values input during use, 
it does not check the plausibility of the calculations performed.
Accessing the Drug Calculator
♦ To access the Drug Calculator, select Main Setup -> Calculations -> 
Drug Calculator, or select the Drug Calculator SmartKey, if 
configured.

26 Using the Drug Calculator Performing Drug CalculationsPerforming Drug Calculations 
Using the service Support Tool, a list of drugs can be configured for the monitor containing pre-
defined dosage recommendations and unit settings. Selecting the arrow beside the drug name in the 
Drug Calculator window opens a list of configured drugs. Contact your pharmacist if you have any 
questions about the drugs in the list. 
If Any Drug is the only entry in the list of drugs, no drugs have been preconfigured for your 
monitor. Drug calculations can be performed for non-specific drugs. 
You must have a Support Tool to add additional drugs to the Drug Calculator.
About the Rule of Six
If the Rule of Six has been enabled for use with individual drugs in your Drug Calculator, you can use 
the formula in crisis situations to quickly calculate the amount of a drug needed to yield a target dose 
for continuous infusion for neonatal or pediatric patients (the drug amount is given in “mg”, the 
patient weight in “kg”). The Rule of Six can only be used with the dose unit mcg/kg/min. 
CAUTION JCAHO recommends disabling the Rule of Six. The configuration is not JCAHO-compliant if Rule of 
Six is enabled.
The Drug Calculator uses the following formula for Rule of Six calculations, based on the patient’s 
weight:
• For a target dose of 0.1 mcg/kg/min, the Drug Calculator multiplies 0.6 x patient weight to 
calculate the amount you need to add to the IV solution to equal a total of 100 ml.
• For a target dose of 1.0 mcg/kg/min, the Drug Calculator multiplies 6.0 x patient weight to 
calculate the amount you need to add to the IV solution to equal a total of 100 ml.
Performing Calculations for a Non-Specific Drug 
If a list of drugs has not been configured for your monitor, 
you can use the Drug Calculator to calculate drug doses for a 
single, generic drug called “Any Drug”. Selecting the arrow 
beside the drug name in the Drug Calculator window shows 
that are no other drugs configured. 
1 Enter three of these four values: dose, amount, volume, 
and rate of the infusion solution. 
To enter values, select the correct unit, then select each 
value field and use the pop-up keypad to enter the correct 
value. 
2 If you have chosen a weight-dependent dose unit, you 
must enter the patient weight now or choose a different 
unit. 
If available, the patient weight from the Patient Demographic window is entered 
automatically in the Drug Calculator window when the Drug Calculator is accessed. To change the 
patient weight, select the Weight key then use the on-screen keypad to enter the correct value. 
This will not change the patient weight stored in the patient demographic information.

2929Respiratory Loops
Using a VueLink module connected to a ventilator, you can measure and store graphic representations 
of realtime respiratory loops. Respiratory loops can help you recognize changes in your patient’s lung 
function , and they can also indicate a fault in the airway tubing (for example, if the respiratory loop 
does not close).
You can measure: 
• Pressure-volume loops 
• Pressure-flow loops
• Volume-flow loops.
Note that you cannot store loops from different patients and different source devices in the same list as 
they are patient and device specific.This prevents you from inadvertently comparing information from 
different patients. 
Viewing Loops 
In the loops display, the current loop is drawn in white, and up to six stored loops are color-coded to 
match their timestamps. The currently-used source device is shown in the window title.
To view respiratory loops permanently on your Screen,

when you disconnect from power, to suit the most common transport scenario 
(“TransportBrightn” setting). 
Charging Batteries
Batteries can be charged in monitors used to monitor patients. Charging is quicker in unused 
monitors. Contact your local Philips representative for information on external battery chargers. Use 
only Lithium Ion battery chargers approved by Philips.
1 Insert the batteries into a monitor connected to mains power. The battery LED will light yellow to 
indicate that charging is in process. 
2 Charge the battery until it is full, the battery LED is green, and the battery power gauge is fully 
shaded.
Conditioning Batteries
CAUTION Do not use a monitor being used to monitor patients to condition batteries. The monitor switches off 
automatically when the batteries are empty. 
You must condition a battery when its “battery requires maintenance” symbol shows on the Screen. Do 
not interrupt the charge or discharge cycle during conditioning. To condition a battery, 
1 Insert the battery into a monitor connected to mains power. 
2 Charge the battery until it is completely full. Open the Battery Status window and check 
that the Batteries fully charged or Battery 1 / Battery 2 fully charged 
message is displayed.

Invasive Pressure Accessories 33 AccessoriesInvasive Pressure Accessories
These transducers and accessories are designed to have special protection against electric 
shocks (particularly regarding allowable leakage currents), and are defibrillator proof.
If you are using the M3012A Hemodynamic Measurement Server Extension, and you 
want to measure temperature and invasive pressure at the same time, we recommend 
that you use the pressure transducer CPJ840J6, with a round module connector piece, and 
not a transducer with a square connector. Pressure transducers with square connectors may 
make it difficult to connect the adjacent Temperature connector at the same time. 
SpO2 Accessories
This section lists accessories for use with Philips SpO2 technology. For accessory lists for other SpO2 
technologies, refer to the instructions for use provided with these devices. 
Some Nellcor sensors contain natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions. See the 
Instructions for Use supplied with the sensors for more information. M1901B, M1902B, M1903B 
and M1904B disposable sensors are not available in USA from Philips. Purchase Nellcor sensors and 
adapter cables directly from Tyco Healthcare.
Do not use more than one extension cable with any sensors or adapter cables. Do not use an extension 
cable with Philips reusable sensors or adapter cables with part numbers ending in -L (indicates “Long” 
version).
All listed sensors operate without risk of exceeding 41oC on the skin if ambient temperature is below 
37oC.

BIS Accessories
Use only Aspect BIS sensors with the BIS module or BIS Interface board (MP20/MP30). The sensor is 
a silver/silverchloride electrode array that uses Aspect’s patented ZipPrep technology and a proprietary 
connector. The sensor/electrodes are for single patient use only. Check shelf-life before use.
The patient interface cable (Philips Ordering No. M1034-61630, Aspect Part No. 186-0131) has an 
estimated lifetime of one year. Do not scrap it when disposing of the BIS sensor.
The sensor cable from the Semi-Reusable Sensor is re-usable but has a maximum number of uses, the 
electrodes are single patient use only. The monitor displays how many uses remain for the sensor cable.

3434Installation and Specifications
The specifications in this section apply to the MP20, MP30, MP40, MP50, MP60, MP70, MP80 and 
MP90 patient monitors, unless otherwise stated. 
The monitors are not user installable. They must be installed by qualified service personnel.
Intended Use
The monitors are intended to be used for monitoring, recording, and alarming of multiple 
physiological parameters of adults, pediatrics, and neonates in health care facilities. The devices are to 
be used by trained health care professionals. 
All the monitors are intended for use in health care facilities; the MP20/MP30/MP40/MP50 monitors 
are additionally intended for use in transport situations within the hospital setting. 
The monitors are only for use on one patient at a time. They are not intended for home use. Rx only: 
U.S. Federal Law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician. Not a therapeutic device.
The transcutaneous gas measurement (tcGas) is restricted to neonatal patients only. 
ST segment monitoring is intended for use with adult patients only and is not clinically validated for 
use with neonatal and pediatric patients. 
The ECG measurement is intended to be used for diagnostic recording of rhythm and detailed 
morphology of complex cardiac complexes (according to AAMI EC 11). 
BIS is intended for use under the direct supervision of a licensed health care practitioner or by 
personnel trained in its proper use.  It is intended for use on adult and pediatric patients within a 
hospital or medical facility providing patient care to monitor the state of the brain by data acquisition 
of EEG signals. The BIS may be used as an aid in monitoring the effects of certain anesthetic agents.  
Use of BIS monitoring to help guide anesthetic administration may be associated with the reduction of 
the incidence of awareness with recall in adults during general anesthesia and sedation. 
Indication for Use
The monitor is indicated for use by health care professionals whenever there is a need for monitoring 
the physiological parameters of patients.325

Heart Rate Averaging Method Three different methods are used:
Normally, heart rate is computed by averaging the 12 most 
recent RR intervals.
For runs of PVCs, up to 8 RR intervals are averaged to compute 
the HR.
If each of 3 consecutive RR intervals is greater than 1200 ms 
(that is, rate less than 50 bpm), then the 4 most recent RR 
intervals are averaged to compute the HR.
Response Time of Heart Rate Meter to Change in 
Heart Rate
HR change from 80 to 120 bpm:
Range: [6.4 to 7.2 seconds] Average: 6.8 seconds
HR change from 80 to 40 bpm:

Safety and Performance Tests 34 Installation and SpecificationsSafety and Performance Tests
You must observe any national regulations on the qualification of the testing personnel and suitable 
measuring and testing facilities. See the maintenance section for a list of required tests. Safety and 
performance tests, and what to do if the instrument does not meet these specifications are described in 
the Installation and Service guide.
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Specifications
Take special precautions regarding electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) when using medical electrical 
equipment. You must operate your monitoring equipment according to the EMC information 
provided in this book. Portable and mobile radio frequency (RF) communications equipment can 
affect medical electrical equipment.
Accessories Compliant with EMC Standards
All accessories listed in the accessories section comply, in combination with the IntelliVue patient 
monitors, with the requirements of IEC 60601-1-2:2001.
WARNING Using accessories other than those specified may result in increased electromagnetic emission or 
decreased electromagnetic immunity of the monitoring equipment.
Electromagnetic Emissions
The monitor is suitable for use in the electromagnetic environment specified in the table below. You 
must ensure that it is used in such an environment
Avoiding Electromagnetic Interference (Resp and BIS)
The respiration (Resp) and BIS measurements are very sensitive measurements that measure very small 
signals. Technological limitations don't allow higher immunity levels than 1V/m for radiated RF 
electromagnetic fields and 1Vrms for conducted disturbances induced by RF fields. Electromagnetic 
fields with field strengths above 1 V/m and conducted disturbances above 1Vrms may cause erroneous 
measurements. Therefore Philips recommends that you avoid using electrically radiating equipment in 
the close proximity of these measurements. 
WARNING The monitor should not be used next to or stacked with other equipment. If you must stack the 
monitor, you must check that normal operation is possible in the necessary configuration before you 
start monitoring patients.
Emissions test Compliance Avoiding Electromagnetic Interference
Radio Frequency (RF) emissions Group 1 The monitor uses RF energy only for its internal function. 
Therefore, its RF emissions are very low and are not likely to 
cause any interference in nearby electronic equipment
RF emissions CISPR 11 Class A The monitor is suitable for use in all establishments other 
than domestic and those directly connected to the public 
low-voltage power supply network that supplies buildings 
used for domestic purposes
Harmonic emissions IEC 61000-3-2 n/a
Voltage fluctuations IEC 61000-3-3 n/a365
34 Installation and Specifications Safety and Performance TestsElectromagnetic Immunity
The monitor is suitable for use in the specified electromagnetic environment. The user must ensure 
that it is used in the appropriate environment as described below.
In this table, UT is the a.c. mains voltage prior to application of the test level.
Recommended Separation Distance
WARNING The monitor, equipped with a wireless network interface, intentionally receives RF electromagnetic 
energy for the purpose of its operation. Therefore, other equipment may cause interference, even if that 
other equipment complies with CISPR emission requirements.
In the following table, P is the maximum output power rating of the transmitter in watts (W) 
according to the transmitter manufacturer and d is the recommended separation distance in metres 
(m). The values given in brackets are for respiration and BIS. 
Portable and mobile RF communications equipment should be used no closer to any part of the 
monitor, including cables, than the recommended separation distance calculated from the equation 
appropriate for the frequency of the transmitter.
Field strengths from fixed RF transmitters, as determined by an electromagnetic site survey, should be 
less than the compliance level in each frequency range (over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, 
field strengths should be less than 1 V/m for respiration and BIS and 3 V/m for all other functions).

Safety and Performance Tests 34 Installation and SpecificationsInterference may occur in the vicinity of equipment marked with this symbol:
Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular, cordless) telephones and 
land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted 
theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an 
electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the location in 
which the monitor is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the monitor should be 
observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be 
necessary, such as reorienting or relocating the monitor. 
These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption 
and reflection from structures, objects, and people.
Recommended separation distances from portable and mobile RF 
communication equipment
The monitor is intended for use in an electromagnetic environment in which radiated RF disturbances 
are controlled. The customer or user of the monitor can help prevent electromagnetic interference by 
maintaining a minimum distance between portable and mobile RF communications equipment and 
the monitor as recommended below, according to the maximum output power of the communications 
equipment.
